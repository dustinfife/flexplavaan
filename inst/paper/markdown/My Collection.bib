abstract = {We develop a new perspective on research conducted through visualization design study that emphasizes design as a method of inquiry and the broad range of knowledge-contributions achieved through it as multiple, subjective, and socially constructed. From this interpretivist position we explore the nature of visualization design study and develop six criteria for rigor. We propose that rigor is established and judged according to the extent to which visualization design study research and its reporting are INFORMED, REFLEXIVE, ABUNDANT, PLAUSIBLE, RESONANT, and TRANSPARENT. This perspective and the criteria were constructed through a four-year engagement with the discourse around rigor and the nature of knowledge in social science, information systems, and design. We suggest methods from cognate disciplines that can support visualization researchers in meeting these criteria during the planning, execution, and reporting of design study. Through a series of deliberately provocative questions, we explore implications of this new perspective for design study research in visualization, concluding that as a discipline, visualization is not yet well positioned to embrace, nurture, and fully benefit from a rigorous, interpretivist approach to design study. The perspective and criteria we present are intended to stimulate dialogue and debate around the nature of visualization design study and the broader underpinnings of the discipline.},

abstract = {Clear presentation of uncertainty is an exception rather than rule in media articles, data-driven reports, and consumer applications, despite proposed techniques for communicating sources of uncertainty in data. This work considers, Why do so many visualization authors choose not to visualize uncertainty? I contribute a detailed characterization of practices, associations, and attitudes related to uncertainty communication among visualization authors, derived from the results of surveying 90 authors who regularly create visualizations for others as part of their work, and interviewing thirteen influential visualization designers. My results highlight challenges that authors face and expose assumptions and inconsistencies in beliefs about the role of uncertainty in visualization. In particular, a clear contradiction arises between authors' acknowledgment of the value of depicting uncertainty and the norm of omitting direct depiction of uncertainty. To help explain this contradiction, I present a rhetorical model of uncertainty omission in visualization-based communication. I also adapt a formal statistical model of how viewers judge the strength of a signal in a visualization to visualization-based communication, to argue that uncertainty communication necessarily reduces degrees of freedom in viewers' statistical inferences. I conclude with recommendations for how visualization research on uncertainty communication could better serve practitioners' current needs and values while deepening understanding of assumptions that reinforce uncertainty omission.},

abstract = {People take longer to judge part-to-whole relationships with bar graphs than with pie charts or divided bar graphs. Subjects may perform summation operations to establish the whole with bar graphs, which would be unnecessary for other graph types depicting the whole with a single object. To test this summation model, the number of components forming the whole was varied with bars, divided bars, reference bars, and pies in three experiments. Response time increased with the number of components for bar graphs but there was little increase for other graph types in Experiment 1. An accuracy emphasis in Experiment 2 produced generally longer response times, but had little effect on the time per summation. The summation operation was not used when graphs were displayed briefly in Experiment 3, although subjects still took longer with bars. The estimated time for a summation operation is consistent with estimates derived from other research. In general, the bar graph is not effective for proportion judgments, and its disadvantage becomes potentially greater as the number of components increases. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Take-the-best is a decision-making strategy that chooses between alternatives, by searching the cues representing the alternatives in order of cue validity, and choosing the alternative with the first discriminating cue. Theoretical support for take-the-best comes from the “fast and frugal” approach to modeling cognition, which assumes decision-making strategies need to be fast to cope with a competitive world, and be simple to be robust to uncertainty and environmental change. We contribute to the empirical evaluation of take-the-best in two ways. First, we generate four new environments—involving bridge lengths, hamburger prices, theme park attendances, and US university rankings—supplementing the relatively limited number of naturally cue-based environments previously considered. We find that take-the-best is as accurate as rival decision strategies that use all of the available cues. Secondly, we develop 19 new data sets characterizing the change in cities and their populations in four countries. We find that take-the-best maintains its accuracy and limited search as the environments change, even if cue validities learned in one environment are used to make decisions in another. Once again, we find that take-the-best is as accurate as rival strategies that use all of the cues. We conclude that these new evaluations support the theoretical claims of the accuracy, frugality, and robustness for take-the-best, and that the new data sets provide a valuable resource for the more general study of the relationship between effective decision-making strategies and the environments in which they operate.},

abstract = {Uncertainty visualizations often emphasize point estimates to support magnitude estimates or decisions through visual comparison. However, when design choices emphasize means, users may overlook uncertainty information and misinterpret visual distance as a proxy for effect size. We present findings from a mixed design experiment on Mechanical Turk which tests eight uncertainty visualization designs: 95{\%} containment intervals, hypothetical outcome plots, densities, and quantile dotplots, each with and without means added. We find that adding means to uncertainty visualizations has small biasing effects on both magnitude estimation and decision-making, consistent with discounting uncertainty. We also see that visualization designs that support the least biased effect size estimation do not support the best decision-making, suggesting that a chart user's sense of effect size may not necessarily be identical when they use the same information for different tasks. In a qualitative analysis of users' strategy descriptions, we find that many users switch strategies and do not employ an optimal strategy when one exists. Uncertainty visualizations which are optimally designed in theory may not be the most effective in practice because of the ways that users satisfice with heuristics, suggesting opportunities to better understand visualization effectiveness by modeling sets of potential strategies.},

A common method of analyzing and displaying interactions is to create simple-slopes or marginal-effects plots using standard software programs. However, these plots omit features that are essential to both graphic integrity and statistical inference. For example, they often do not display all quantities of interest, omit information about uncertainty, or do not show the observed data underlying an interaction, and failure to include these features undermines the strength of the inferences that may be drawn from such displays. Here, we review the strengths and limitations of present practices in analyzing and visualizing interaction effects in psychology. We provide simulated examples of the conditions under which visual displays may lead to inappropriate inferences and introduce open-source software that provides optimized utilities for analyzing and visualizing interactions.},

abstract = {Fig. 1. We present two experiments (E1 and E2) evaluating four different uncertainty visualizations (from left to right): bar graphs with error bars, bar hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs), static line ensembles, and line HOPs. Abstract-Animated representations of outcomes drawn from distributions (hypothetical outcome plots, or HOPs) are used in the media and other public venues to communicate uncertainty. HOPs greatly improve multivariate probability estimation over conventional static uncertainty visualizations and leverage the ability of the visual system to quickly, accurately, and automatically process the summary statistical properties of ensembles. However, it is unclear how well HOPs support applied tasks resembling real world judgments posed in uncertainty communication. We identify and motivate an appropriate task to investigate realistic judgments of uncertainty in the public domain through a qualitative analysis of uncertainty visualizations in the news. We contribute two crowdsourced experiments comparing the effectiveness of HOPs, error bars, and line ensembles for supporting perceptual decision-making from visualized uncertainty. Participants infer which of two possible underlying trends is more likely to have produced a sample of time series data by referencing uncertainty visualizations which depict the two trends with variability due to sampling error. By modeling each participant's accuracy as a function of the level of evidence presented over many repeated judgments, we find that observers are able to correctly infer the underlying trend in samples conveying a lower level of evidence when using HOPs rather than static aggregate uncertainty visualizations as a decision aid. Modeling approaches like ours contribute theoretically grounded and richly descriptive accounts of user perceptions to visualization evaluation.},

How does this choice impact readers' beliefs about the size of treatment effects? We investigate this question in two experiments comparing 95{\%} confidence intervals (means and standard errors) to 95{\%} prediction intervals (means and standard deviations). The first experiment finds that participants are willing to pay more for and overestimate the effect of a treatment when shown confidence intervals relative to prediction intervals. The second experiment evaluates how alternative visualizations compare to standard visualizations for different effect sizes. We find that axis rescaling reduces error, but not as well as prediction intervals or animated hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs), and that depicting inferential uncertainty causes participants to underestimate variability in individual outcomes.

abstract = {As statisticians and scientists consider a world beyond p {\textless} 0.05, it is important to not lose sight of how we got to this point. Although significance testing and p-values are often presented as prescriptive procedures, they came about through a process of refinement and extension to other disciplines. Ronald A. Fisher and his contemporaries formalized these methods in the early twentieth century and Fisher's 1925 Statistical Methods for Research Workers brought the techniques to experimentalists in a variety of disciplines. Understanding how these methods arose, spread, and were argued over since then illuminates how p {\textless} 0.05 came to be a standard for scientific inference, the advantage it offered at the time, and how it was interpreted. This historical perspective can inform the work of statisticians today by encouraging thoughtful consideration of how their work, including proposed alternatives to the p-value, will be perceived and used by scientists. And it can engage students more fully and encourage critical thinking rather than rote applications of formulae. Incorporating history enables students, practitioners, and statisticians to treat the discipline as an ongoing endeavor, crafted by fallible humans, and provides a deeper understanding of the subject and its consequences for science and society.},

abstract = {In 2010-2012, a few largely coincidental events led experimental psychologists to realize that their approach to collecting, analyzing, and reporting data made it too easy to publish false-positive findings. This sparked a period of methodological reflection that we review here and call Psy-chology's Renaissance. We begin by describing how psychologists' concerns with publication bias shifted from worrying about file-drawered studies to worrying about p-hacked analyses. We then review the methodological changes that psychologists have proposed and, in some cases, embraced. In describing how the renaissance has unfolded, we attempt to describe different points of view fairly but not neutrally, so as to identify the most promising paths forward. In so doing, we champion disclosure and preregistration, express skepticism about most statistical solutions to publication bias, take positions on the analysis and interpretation of replication failures, and contend that meta-analytical thinking increases the prevalence of false positives. Our general thesis is that the scientific practices of experimental psychologists have improved dramatically. 511},
annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Psychology's Renaissance - Nelson, Leif D.; Simmons, Joseph P.; Simonsohn, Uri)

This article places an overemphasis on openness, transparency, and data policing. Yes, these will decrease false positives. However, we will soon have a second replication crisis, where we realize nothing is replicable. The problem is that this article still relies on NHST methodology which doesn't address the issues they want to address. It is ill equipped to assess replicability or even invite a cumulative view of science. That's what's missing here. 

Again, the authors still seem to think that one study can be conclusive. No amount of positive studies will prove an effect, nor will negative studies disprove it. Yet they treat one failed replication as inconclusive due to context dependent variables. Probably not. Probably it's just noise.

That's what's missing here: they fail to account for noise. NHST sucks at recognizing noise, mostly because it's non cumulative. Bayesian is better, but best when it's used over multiple studies.},

abstract = {For almost half a century, Paul Meehl educated psychologists about how the mindless use of null-hypothesis significance tests made research on theories in the social sciences basically uninterpretable (Meehl, 1990). In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalising procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and impactful. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychologists have begun to realise that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound ‘derivation chain' between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various non-confirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and their functional form, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognised and incentivised as a crucial goal in and of itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to non-confirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology's reform movement and help us lay the foundation to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged us to.},

abstract = {Efforts to address a reproducibility crisis have generated several valid proposals for improving the quality of scientific research. We argue there is also need to address the separate but related issues of relevance and responsiveness. To address relevance, researchers must produce what decision makers actually need to inform investments and public policy—that is, the probability that a claim is true or the probability distribution of an effect size given the data. The term responsiveness refers to the irregularity and delay in which issues about the quality of research are brought to light. Instead of relying on the good fortune that some motivated researchers will periodically conduct efforts to reveal potential shortcomings of published research, we could establish a continuous quality-control process for scientific research itself. Quality metrics could be designed through the application of this statistical process control for the research enterprise. We argue that one quality control metric—the probability that a research hypothesis is true—is required to address at least relevance and may also be part of the solution for improving responsiveness and reproducibility. This article proposes a “straw man” solution which could be the basis of implementing these improvements. As part of this solution, we propose one way to “bootstrap” priors. The processes required for improving reproducibility and relevance can also be part of a comprehensive statistical quality control for science itself by making continuously monitored metrics about the scientific performance of a field of research.},

Dramatic citation-count data on 25 articles and books severely critical of NHST's negative impact on good science, underlining that this issue was/is well known, did nothing to stem its usage over the period 1960–2007. On the contrary, employment of NHST increased during this time. To be successful in this endeavor, as well as restoring the relevance of the statistics profession to the scientific community in the 21st century, the ASA must be prepared to dispense detailed advice.

abstract = {Relying on effect size as a measure of practical significance is turning out to be just as misleading as using p-values to determine the effectiveness of interventions for improving clinical practice in complex organizations such as schools. This article explains how effect sizes have misdirected practice in education and other disciplines. Even when effect size is incorporated into RCT research the recommendations of whether interventions are effective are misleading and generally useless to practitioners. As a result, a new criterion of practical benefit is recommended for evaluating research findings about the effectiveness of interventions in complex organizations where benchmarks of existing performance exist. Practical benefit exists when the unadjusted performance of an experimental group provides a noticeable advantage over an existing benchmark. Some basic principles for determining practical benefit are provided. Practical benefit is more intuitive and is expected to enable leaders to make more accurate assessments as to whether published research findings are likely to produce noticeable improvements in their organizations. In addition, practical benefit is used routinely as the research criterion for the alternative scientific methodology of improvement science that has an established track record of being a more efficient way to develop new interventions that improve practice dramatically than RCT research. Finally, the problems with practical significance suggest that the research community should seek different inferential methods for research designed to improve clinical performance in complex organizations, as compared to methods for testing theories and medicines.},

The resulting hypothesis tests do not violate the Likelihood Principle and do not require any constraints on the dimensionalities of the sample space and parameter space. The procedure includes an ordering of the entire sample space and uses predictive probability (density) functions, allowing for testing of both simple and compound hypotheses.

According to classroom studies, inquiry that students conduct in science classes seems to have little effect on their decision-making. Predetermined values play a large role in students' decision-making, but students do not explore these values or evaluate whether they are appropriate to the particular issue they are deciding, and they often ignore relevant scientific information. We explore how to connect inquiry and values, and how this connection can contribute to informed decision-making based on John Dewey's philosophy. Dewey argues that scientific inquiry should include value judgments and that conducting inquiry can improve the ability to make good value judgments. Value judgment is essential to informed, rational decision-making, and Dewey's ideas can explain how conducting inquiry can contribute to make an informed decision through value judgment. According to Dewey, each value judgment during inquiry is a practical judgment guiding action, and students can improve their value judgments by evaluating their actions during scientific inquiry. Thus, we suggest that students need an opportunity to explore values through scientific inquiry and that practicing value judgment will help informed decision-makings.},

Using the example of offender rehabilitation, we suggest that it is the values that we hold that determine how knowledge about what works is defined and how priorities for professional engagement are set. Specifically, we argue that there has been too great an emphasis on a particular set of epistemic values and insufficient attention paid to the importance of prudential and moral or social cultural values in the way in which rehabilitation services have developed. This has resulted in practices that have largely failed to deliver the types of social benefit that are intended, supported by a policy paradigm that privileges particular approaches. The argument is illustrated with reference to the failure to deliver effective rehabilitation to Indigenous peoples in both Australia and New Zealand.

abstract = {The role of science in policymaking has gained unprecedented stature in the United States, raising questions about the place of science and scientific expertise in the democratic process. Some scientists have been given considerable epistemic authority in shaping policy on issues of great moral and cultural significance, and the politicizing of these issues has become highly contentious. Since World War II, most philosophers of science have purported the concept that science should be "value-free." InScience, Policy and the Value-Free Ideal,Heather E. Douglas argues that such an ideal is neither adequate nor desirable for science. She contends that the moral responsibilities of scientists require the consideration of values even at the heart of science. She lobbies for a new ideal in which values serve an essential function throughout scientific inquiry, but where the role values play is constrained at key points, thus protecting the integrity and objectivity of science. In this vein, Douglas outlines a system for the application of values to guide scientists through points of uncertainty fraught with moral valence. Following a philosophical analysis of the historical background of science advising and the value-free ideal, Douglas defines how values should-and should not-function in science. She discusses the distinctive direct and indirect roles for values in reasoning, and outlines seven senses of objectivity, showing how each can be employed to determine the reliability of scientific claims. Douglas then uses these philosophical insights to clarify the distinction between junk science and sound science to be used in policymaking. In conclusion, she calls for greater openness on the values utilized in policymaking, and more public participation in the policymaking process, by suggesting various models for effective use of both the public and experts in key risk assessments.},

While value freedom construed as an absence of social and moral values in scientific work has been discredited, defenders of value freedom bracket off methodological values or practices from social and moral ones. In this paper I will first show how values exist along a continuum and argue that science is and should be value based. One of these values is necessarily objectivity for science to be possible. However the version of objectivity I will describe is socially situated in methodological practice, but also crucially in the particular purpose of a given science. Objectivity (or its absence) may be transferred vertically from practices, goals, or discourses outside science through several levels to that of the daytoday activities of the scientist. It is also possible for this transfer to occur in the other direction and indeed objectivity can be situated in extrascientific practices and discourses. Objectivity (or its absence) may also be transferred horizontally within particular methodological practice to other disciplines or parts of a discipline. Ultimately a socially situated objectivity is an achievement of the community of science. I will use some brief contemporary and historical illustrations from science and the intersection of science and public policy to show how objectivity has been achieved or failed.},

abstract = {Scientists should be able to provide support for the absence of a meaningful effect. Currently, researchers often incorrectly conclude an effect is absent based a nonsignificant result. A widely recommended approach within a frequentist framework is to test for equivalence. In equivalence tests, such as the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure discussed in this article, an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest. The TOST procedure can be used to statistically reject the presence of effects large enough to be considered worthwhile. This practical primer with accompanying spreadsheet and R package enables psychologists to easily perform equivalence tests (and power analyses) by setting equivalence bounds based on standardized effect sizes and provides recommendations to prespecify equivalence bounds. Extending your statistical tool kit with equivalence tests is an easy way to improve your statistical and theoretical inferences.},

abstract = {Abstract: The Internet has evolved into a ubiquitous digital environment in which people communicate, seek information, and make decisions. Online environments are replete with smart, highly adaptive choice architectures designed primarily to maximize commercial interests, capture and sustain users' attention, monetize user data, and predict and influence future behavior. This online landscape holds multiple negative consequences for society, such as a decline in human autonomy, rising incivility in online conversation, the facilitation of political extremism, and the spread of disinformation. Benevolent choice architects working with regulators may curb the worst excesses of manipulative choice architectures, yet the strategic advantages, resources, and data remain with commercial players. One way to address this imbalance is with interventions that empower Internet users to gain some control over their digital environments, in part by boosting their information literacy and their cognitive resistance to manipulation. Our goal is to present a conceptual map of interventions that are based on insights from psychological science. We begin by systematically outlining how online and offline environments differ despite being increasingly inextricable. We then identify four major types of challenges that users encounter in online environments: persuasive and manipulative choice architectures, AI-assisted information architectures, distractive environments, and false and misleading information. Next, we turn to how psychological science can inform interventions to counteract these challenges of the digital world. After distinguishing between three types of behavioral and cognitive interventions— nudges, technocognition, and boosts—we focus in on boosts, of which we identify two main groups: (1) those aimed at enhancing people's agency in their digital environments (e.g., self- nudging, deliberate ignorance) and (2) those aimed at boosting competences of reasoning and resilience to manipulation (e.g., simple decision aids, inoculation). These cognitive tools are designed to foster the civility of online discourse and protect reason and human autonomy against manipulative choice architectures, attention-grabbing techniques, and the spread of false information.},

For example, the practice of hypothesizing after the results are known (HARKing) involves the reconstruction of hypotheses and stories after results have been obtained (Kerr, 1998) and thereby promotes the retrospective fabrication of favorable hypotheses (cf. Bem, 2004). P-hacking encompasses various untruthful manipulations for obtaining p-values less than 0.05 (Simmons et al., 2011). Such unethical practices dramatically increase the number of false positive findings and thereby encourage the intentional fabrication of evidence as the basis of scientific knowledge and theory, which leads to individual profits for researchers.},

The impact of these errors on factor loading estimates is understudied. Factor loadings underlie our assessments of the validity and reliability of indicators. Thus knowing how structural misspecifications affect a factor loading is a key issue. This paper develops analytic conditions of when misspecifications affect Bollen's (1996) model implied instrumental variable, two stage least squares (MIIV-2SLS) estimator of a factor loading. It shows that if an indicator equation is correctly specified, then correlated errors among other measures, mixing up causal indicators with reflective, omitting cross loadings, and omitting direct effects between indicators leave the MIIV-2SLS estimator of the factor loading unchanged. Alternatively, if the indicator or the scaling indicator equation is misspecified, then the loading is unlikely to be robust. The results are illustrated with hypothetical and empirical examples.},

However, in a world in which measurements are noisy and effects are small, this will not work: selection on statistical significance leads to effect sizes which are overestimated and often in the wrong direction. After a brief discussion of two examples, one in economics and one in social psychology, we consider the procedural solution of open postpublication review, the design solution of devoting more effort to accurate measurements and within-person comparisons, and the statistical analysis solution of multilevel modeling and reporting all results rather than selection on significance. We argue that the current replication crisis in science arises in part from the ill effects of null hypothesis significance testing being used to study small effects with noisy data. In such settings, apparent success comes easy but truly replicable results require a more serious connection between theory, measurement, and data.},

Such practices include design, analytic, or reporting practices that may introduce biased evidence, which can have harmful implications for evidence-based practice, theory development, and perceptions of the rigor of science. Design/Methodology/Approach: To assess the extent to which QRPs are actually a concern, we conducted a systematic review to consider the evidence on QRPs. Using a triangulation approach (e.g., by reviewing data from observations, sensitivity analyses, and surveys), we identified the good, the bad, and the ugly. Findings: Of the 64 studies that fit our criteria, 6 appeared to find little to no evidence of engagement in QRPs and the other 58 found more severe evidence (91 {\%}). Implications: Drawing upon the findings, we provide recommendations for future research related to publication practices and academic training. Originality/value: We report findings from studies that suggest that QRPs are not a problem, that QRPs are used at a suboptimal rate, and that QRPs present a threat to the viability of organizational science research.},

Second, a Bayesian randomeffects meta-analysis for all 38 t-tests showed that only one out of the 38 hierarchically estimated credible intervals did not overlap with zero and fell in the expected direction.

abstract = {Background: Missing data are unavoidable in epidemiological research, potentially leading to bias and loss of precision. Multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete case analysis (CCA). However, contrary to widespread belief, CCA is preferable to MI in some situations. Methods: We provide guidance on choice of analysis when data are incomplete. Using causal diagrams to depict missingness mechanisms, we describe when CCA will not be biased by missing data and compare MI and CCA, with respect to bias and efficiency, in a range of missing data situations. We illustrate selection of an appropriate method in practice. Results: For most regression models, CCA gives unbiased results when the chance of being a complete case does not depend on the outcome after taking the covariates into consideration, which includes situations where data are missing not at random. Consequently, there are situations in which CCA analyses are unbiased while MI analyses, assuming missing at random (MAR), are biased. By contrast MI, unlike CCA, is valid for all MAR situations and has the potential to use information contained in the incomplete cases and auxiliary variables to reduce bias and/or improve precision. For this reason, MI was preferred over CCA in our real data example. Conclusions: Choice of method for dealing with missing data is crucial for validity of conclusions, and should be based on careful consideration of the reasons for the missing data, missing data patterns and the availability of auxiliary information.},

Selective reporting occurred in nearly 50{\%} of studies. Fully supported dissertation hypotheses were 3 times more likely to be published than unsupported hypotheses, while unsupported hypotheses were nearly 4 times more likely to be dropped from publications.

@article{Mackinlay1986,
abstract = {The goal of the research described in this paper is to develop an application-independent presentation tool that automatically designs effective graphical presentations (such as bar charts, scatter plots, and connected graphs) of relational information. Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria. {\textcopyright} 1986, ACM.

abstract = {Figures in scientific publications are critically important because they often show the data supporting key findings. Our systematic review of research articles published in top physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies. Investigators can quickly make univariate scatterplots for small sample size studies using our Excel templates.},

abstract = {Data quality issues such as missing, erroneous, extreme and duplicate values undermine analysis and are time-consuming to find and fix. Automated methods can help identify anomalies, but determining what constitutes an error is context-dependent and so requires human judgment. While visualization tools can facilitate this process, analysts must often manually construct the necessary views, requiring significant expertise. We present Profiler, a visual analysis tool for assessing quality issues in tabular data. Profiler applies data mining methods to automatically flag problematic data and suggests coordinated summary visualizations for assessing the data in context. The system contributes novel methods for integrated statistical and visual analysis, automatic view suggestion, and scalable visual summaries that support real-time interaction with millions of data points. We present Profiler's architecture - - including modular components for custom data types, anomaly detection routines and summary visualizations - - and describe its application to motion picture, natural disaster and water quality data sets. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

@article{Correll2019,
abstract = {Famous examples such as Anscombe's Quartet highlight that one of the core benefits of visualizations is allowing people to discover visual patterns that might otherwise be hidden by summary statistics. This visual inspection is particularly important in exploratory data analysis, where analysts can use visualizations such as histograms and dot plots to identify data quality issues. Yet, these visualizations are driven by parameters such as histogram bin size or mark opacity that have a great deal of impact on the final visual appearance of the chart, but are rarely optimized to make important features visible. In this paper, we show that data flaws have varying impact on the visual features of visualizations, and that the adversarial or merely uncritical setting of design parameters of visualizations can obscure the visual signatures of these flaws. Drawing on the framework of Algebraic Visualization Design, we present the results of a crowdsourced study showing that common visualization types can appear to reasonably summarize distributional data while hiding large and important flaws such as missing data and extraneous modes. We make use of these results to propose additional best practices for visualizations of distributions for data quality tasks.},

This process of data exploration consists of multiple tasks: data ingestion, visualization, statistical analysis, and storytelling. Though these tasks are complementary, analysts often execute them in separate tools. Moreover, these tools have steep learning curves due to their reliance on manual query specification. Here, we describe the design and implementation of DIVE, a web-based system that integrates state-of-the-art data exploration features into a single tool. DIVE contributes a mixed-initiative interaction scheme that combines recommendation with point-and-click manual specification, and a consistent visual language that unifies different stages of the data exploration workflow. In a controlled user study with 67 professional data scientists, we find that DIVE users were significantly more successful and faster than Excel users at completing predefined data visualization and analysis tasks.},

Statistics and graphing trends in JEAB largely paralleled those in mainstream psychology journals, but there was no evidence that changes to APA style had any direct impact on JEAB.

@article{Amrhein2019a,
abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

It then discusses several properties of P-values that have been presented as fatal flaws: That P-values exhibit extreme variation across samples (and thus are “unreliable”), confound effect size with sample size, are sensitive to sample size, and depend on investigator sampling intentions. These properties are often criticized from a likelihood or Bayesian framework, yet they are exactly the properties P-values should exhibit when they are constructed and interpreted correctly within their originating framework. Other common criticisms are that P-values force users to focus on irrelevant hypotheses and overstate evidence against those hypotheses. These problems are not however properties of P-values but are faults of researchers who focus on null hypotheses and overstate evidence based on misperceptions that p = 0.05 represents enough evidence to reject hypotheses. Those problems are easily seen without use of Bayesian concepts by translating the observed P-value p into the Shannon information (S-value or surprisal) –log 2 (p).},

This article proposes four new corrected statistics, aiming for better model evaluation with nonnormally distributed data at small sample sizes. A Monte Carlo study is conducted to compare the performances of the four corrected statistics against those of existing statistics regarding Type I error rate. Results show that the performances of the four new statistics are relatively stable compared with those of existing statistics. In particular, Type I error rates of a new statistic are close to the nominal level across all sample sizes under a condition of asymptotic robustness. Other new statistics also exhibit improved Type I error control, especially with nonnormally distributed data at small sample sizes.},

Unfortunately, even if the fit of the measurement portion of the model is perfect, the ability to assess the fit within the structural portion is affected by the quality of the factor-variable relations within the measurement model. The result is that models with poorer quality measurement appear to have better data-model fit, whereas models with better quality measurement appear to have worse data-model fit. The current article illustrates this phenomenon across different classes of fit indices, discusses related structural assessment problems resulting from issues of measurement quality, and endorses a supplemental modeling step evaluating the structural portion of the model in isolation from the measurement model. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The asymptotically distribution free (ADF) method is often used to estimate parameters or test models without a normal distribution assumption on variables, both in covariance structure analysis and in correlation structure analysis. However, little has been done to study the differences in behaviors of the ADF method in covariance versus correlation structure analysis. The behaviors of 3 test statistics frequently used to evaluate structural equation models with nonnormally distributed variables, $\chi${\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} test T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}AGLS{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and its small-sample variants T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}YB{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}F{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} {\textless}inf{\textgreater}(AGLS){\textless}/inf{\textgreater} were compared. Results showed that the ADF method in correlation structure analysis with test statistic T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}AGLS{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} performs much better at small sample sizes than the corresponding test for covariance structures. In contrast, test statistics T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}YB{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}F{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} {\textless}inf{\textgreater}(AGLS){\textless}/inf{\textgreater} under the same conditions generally perform better with covariance structures than with correlation structures. It is proposed that excessively large and variable condition numbers of weight matrices are a cause of poor behavior of ADF test statistics in small samples, and results showed that these condition numbers are systematically increased with substantial increase in variance as sample size decreases. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

abstract = {Fit indices are widely used in order to test the model fit for structural equation models. In a highly influential study, Hu and Bentler (1999) showed that certain cutoff values for these indices could be derived, which, over time, has led to the reification of these suggested thresholds as " golden rules" for establishing the fit or other aspects of structural equation models. The current study shows how differences in unique variances influence the value of the global chi-square model test and the most commonly used fit indices: Root-mean-square error of approximation, standardized root-mean-square residual, and the comparative fit index. Using data simulation, the authors illustrate how the value of the chi-square test, the root-mean-square error of approximation, and the standardized root-mean-square residual are decreased when unique variances are increased although model misspecification is present. For a broader understanding of the phenomenon, the authors used different sample sizes, number of observed variables per factor, and types of misspecification. A theoretical explanation is provided, and implications for the application of structural equation modeling are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Psychological Association.},

Close fit may indeed result from a model being close to properly causally specified, but close-fitting factor models can also be seriously causally misspecified. This article illustrates a variety of nonfactor causal worlds that are perfectly, but inappropriately, fit by factor models. Seeing nonfactor worlds that are perfectly yet erroneously fit via factor models should help researchers understand that close-to-fitting factor models may seriously misrepresent the world's causal structure. Statistical cautions regarding the factor model's proclivity to fit when it ought not to fit have been insufficiently publicized and are rarely heeded. A research commitment to understanding the world's causal structure, combined with clear examples of factor mismodeling should spur diagnostic assessment of significant factor model failures—including reassessment of published failing factor models.},

abstract = {Latent variable modeling is a popular and flexible statistical framework. Concomitant with fitting latent variable models is assessment of how well the theoretical model fits the observed data. Although firm cutoffs for these fit indexes are often cited, recent statistical proofs and simulations have shown that these fit indexes are highly susceptible to measurement quality. For instance, a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) value of 0.06 (conventionally thought to indicate good fit) can actually indicate poor fit with poor measurement quality (e.g., standardized factors loadings of around 0.40). Conversely, an RMSEA value of 0.20 (conventionally thought to indicate very poor fit) can indicate acceptable fit with very high measurement quality (standardized factor loadings around 0.90). Despite the wide-ranging effect on applications of latent variable models, the high level of technical detail involved with this phenomenon has curtailed the exposure of these important findings to empirical researchers who are employing these methods. This article briefly reviews these methodological studies in minimal technical detail and provides a demonstration to easily quantify the large influence measurement quality has on fit index values and how greatly the cutoffs would change if they were derived under an alternative level of measurement quality. Recommendations for best practice are also discussed.},

abstract = {Introduction: Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate data analytic technique used in many domains of addictive behaviors research. SEM results are usually summarized and communicated through statistical tables and path diagrams, which emphasize path coefficients and global fit without showing specific quantitative values of data points that underlie the model results. Data visualization methods are often absent in SEM research, which may limit the quality and impact of SEM research by reducing data transparency, obscuring unexpected data anomalies and unmodeled heterogeneity, and inhibiting the communication of SEM research findings to research stakeholders who do not have advanced statistical training in SEM. Methods and results: In this report, we show how data visualization methods can address these limitations and improve the quality of SEM-based addictive behaviors research. We first introduce SEM and data visualization methodologies and differentiate data visualizations from model visualizations that are commonly used in SEM, such as path diagrams. We then discuss ways researchers may utilize data visualization in SEM research, including by obtaining estimates of latent variables and by visualizing multivariate relations in two-dimensional figures. R syntax is provided to help others generate data visualizations for several types of effects commonly modeled in SEM, including correlation, regression, moderation, and simple mediation. Discussion: The techniques outlined here may help spur the use of data visualization in SEM-based addictive behaviors research. Using data visualization in SEM may enhance methodological transparency and improve communication of research findings.},

@article{McIntosh2007,
abstract = {With seemingly few exceptions, current practice in structural equation modelling (SEM) aims at establishing close rather than exact fit between hypothetical models and observed data. This orientation has gone without serious challenge until the appearance of a sharp critique by Barrett (2007), who suggests discontinuing the use of approximate fit indices (AFIs) in SEM. The present article provides a commentary and elaboration on the key aspects of Barrett's position, and also supplies further practical guidance and methodological references to applied researchers, who may be motivated to significantly alter their modelling practices in order to address the issues he raises. I strongly support his calls for performing more detailed diagnostic examinations of model misfit when confronted with a significant chi-square ($\chi$2) test statistic, rather than simply deferring to AFIs. However, I do not second the recommendation that assessments of a model's predictive accuracy (e.g., R2 values) can supplant a focused search for the reasons underlying significant global misfit. Accordingly, some misconceptions about the relationship between global model fit and predictive accuracy are pointed out, and modified advice is given to practitioners. Issues surrounding how to properly appraise a model yielding a non-significant $\chi$2 are also discussed, as are concerns raised by Barrett about small sample size and power in SEM. It is concluded that AFIs offer little value-added in SEM practice, given the wide variety of available methods for performing detailed model assessments. However, I leave the issue of whether AFIs should be completely abandoned to future research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Yet when it comes to structural equation models (SEMs), we use estimators that assume true models (e.g. maximum likelihood) and that can create biased estimates when the model is inexact. This article presents an overview of the Model Implied Instrumental Variable (MIIV) approach to SEMs from Bollen (1996). The MIIV estimator using Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS), MIIV-2SLS, has greater robustness to structural misspecifications than system wide estimators. In addition, the MIIV-2SLS estimator is asymptotically distribution free. Furthermore, MIIV-2SLS has equation-based overidentification tests that can help pinpoint misspecifications. Beyond these features, the MIIV approach has other desirable qualities. MIIV methods apply to higher order factor analyses, categorical measures, growth curve models, dynamic factor analysis, and nonlinear latent variables. Finally, MIIV-2SLS permits researchers to estimate and test only the latent variable model or any other subset of equations. In addition, other MIIV estimators beyond 2SLS are available. Despite these promising features, research is needed to better understand its performance under a variety of conditions that represent empirical applications. Empirical and simulation examples in the article illustrate the MIIV orientation to SEMs and highlight an R package MIIVsem that implements MIIV-2SLS.},

Many of these methods provide a global approach to model fit evaluation: A single index is computed that quantifies the fit of the entire SEM to the data. In contrast, graphical criteria like d-separation or trek-separation allow derivation of implications that can be used for local fit evaluation, an approach that is hardly ever applied. We provide an overview of local fit evaluation from the viewpoint of SEM practitioners. In the presence of model misfit, local fit evaluation can potentially help in pinpointing where the problem with the model lies. For models that do fit the data, local tests can identify the parts of the model that are corroborated by the data. Local tests can also be conducted before a model is fitted at all, and they can be used even for models that are globally underidentified. We discuss appropriate statistical local tests, and provide applied examples. We also present novel software in R that automates this type of local fit evaluation.},

This issue is discussed in detail and is explored empirically through sampling studies using 2 large sets of data. Results demonstrate that over repeated samples, model modifications may be very inconsistent and cross-validation results may behave erratically. These findings lead to skepticism about generalizability of models resulting from data-driven modifications of an initial model.

@article{Gonzalez2001,
abstract = {A problem with standard errors estimated by many structural equation modeling programs is described. In such programs, a parameter's standard error is sensitive to how the model is identified (i.e., how scale is set). Alternative but equivalent ways to identify a model may yield different standard errors, and hence different Z tests for a parameter, even though the identifications produce the same overall model fit. This lack of invariance due to model identification creates the possibility that different analysts may reach different conclusions about a parameter's significance level even though they test equivalent models on the same data. The authors suggest that parameters be tested for statistical significance through the likelihood ratio test, which is invariant to the identification choice.},

In this study, 4 fit indexes (RMSEA, CFI, McDonald's Fit Index, and Steiger's gamma) were used to compute the noncentrality parameter and sample size to achieve certain level of power. The resulting power and sample size varied as a function of (a) choice of fit index, (b) number of variables/degrees of freedom, (c) relation among the variables, and (d) value of the fit index. However, if the level of misspecification were held constant, then the resulting power and sample size would be identical.},

abstract = {Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories by way of causal explanation, prediction, and description. In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2010.},

abstract = {The noncentral chi-square distribution plays a key role in structural equation modeling (SEM). The likelihood ratio test statistic that accompanies virtually all SEMs asymptotically follows a noncentral chi-square under certain assumptions relating to misspecification and multivariate distribution. Many scholars use the noncentral chi-square distribution in the construction of fit indices, such as Steiger and Lind's (1980) Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) or the family of baseline fit indices (e.g., RNI, CFI), and for the computation of statistical power for model hypothesis testing. Despite this wide use, surprisingly little is known about the extent to which the test statistic follows a noncentral chi-square in applied research. Our study examines several hypotheses about the suitability of the noncentral chi-square distribution for the usual SEM test statistic under conditions commonly encountered in practice. We designed Monte Carlo computer simulation experiments to empirically test these research hypotheses. Our experimental conditions included seven sample sizes ranging from 50 to 1000, and three distinct model types, each with five specifications ranging from a correct model to the severely misspecified uncorrelated baseline model. In general, we found that for models with small to moderate misspecification, the noncentral chi-square distribution is well approximated when the sample size is large (e.g., greater than 200), but there was evidence of bias in both mean and variance in smaller samples. A key finding was that the test statistics for the uncorrelated variable baseline model did not follow the noncentral chi-square distribution for any model type across any sample size. We discuss the implications of our findings for the SEM fit indices and power estimation procedures that are based on the noncentral chi-square distribution as well as potential directions for future research.},

The behaviors of the population fit indices and their sample estimates were compared under various conditions created by manipulating the number of observed variables, the types of model misspecification, the sample size, and the magnitude of factor loadings. The results showed that the effect of p on the population CFI and TLI depended on the type of specification error, whereas a higher p was associated with lower values of the population RMSEA regardless of the type of model misspecification. In finite samples, all three fit indices tended to yield estimates that suggested a worse fit than their population counterparts, which was more pronounced with a smaller sample size, higher p, and lower factor loading.},

abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing— by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,' such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

abstract = {Background: Inappropriate analysis and reporting of biomedical research remain a problem despite advances in statistical methods and efforts to educate researchers. Objective: To determine the frequency and severity of requests biostatisticians receive from researchers for inappropriate analysis and reporting of data during statistical consultations. Design: Online survey. Setting: United States. Participants: A randomly drawn sample of 522 American Statistical Association members self-identifying as consulting biostatisticians. Measurements: The Bioethical Issues in Biostatistical Consulting Questionnaire soliciting reports about the frequency and perceived severity of specific requests for inappropriate analysis and reporting. Results: Of 522 consulting biostatisticians contacted, 390 provided sufficient responses: A completion rate of 74.7{\%}. The 4 most frequently reported inappropriate requests rated as "most severe" by at least 20{\%} of the respondents were, in order of frequency, removing or altering some data records to better support the research hypothesis; interpreting the statistical findings on the basis of expectation, not actual results; not reporting the presence of key missing data that might bias the results; and ignoring violations of assumptions that would change results from positive to negative. These requests were reported most often by younger biostatisticians. Limitations: The survey provides information on the reported frequency of inappropriate requests but not on how such requests were handled or whether the requests reflected researchers' maleficence or inadequate knowledge about statistical and research methods. In addition, other inappropriate requests may have been made that were not prespecified in the survey. Conclusion: This survey suggests that researchers frequently make inappropriate requests of their biostatistical consultants regarding the analysis and reporting of their data. Understanding the reasons for these requests and how they are handled requires further study. Primary Funding Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.},

abstract = {Good self-control has been linked to adaptive outcomes such as better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the workplace and at school, and less susceptibility to crime and addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding self-control is the strength or resource depletion model. Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting in self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state known as ego depletion. Although a meta-analysis of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses served as a catalyst for the current Registered Replication Report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple laboratories (k = 23, total N = 2,141) conducted replications of a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) that encompassed zero (d = 0.04, 95{\%} CI [−0.07, 0.15]. We discuss implications of the findings for the ego-depletion effect and the resource depletion model of self-control.},

Each prioritizes a different aspect of mean and uncertainty, and results in different patterns of judgment and comprehension for tasks requiring statistical inferences. Abstract-When making an inference or comparison with uncertain, noisy, or incomplete data, measurement error and confidence intervals can be as important for judgment as the actual mean values of different groups. These often misunderstood statistical quantities are frequently represented by bar charts with error bars. This paper investigates drawbacks with this standard encoding, and considers a set of alternatives designed to more effectively communicate the implications of mean and error data to a general audience, drawing from lessons learned from the use of visual statistics in the information visualization community. We present a series of crowd-sourced experiments that confirm that the encoding of mean and error significantly changes how viewers make decisions about uncertain data. Careful consideration of design tradeoffs in the visual presentation of data results in human reasoning that is more consistently aligned with statistical inferences. We suggest the use of gradient plots (which use transparency to encode uncertainty) and violin plots (which use width) as better alternatives for inferential tasks than bar charts with error bars.},

abstract = {There are deep and important philosophical differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to quantifying uncertainty. However, some practitioners choose between these approaches primarily on the basis of convenience. For instance, the ability to incorporate parameter constraints is sometimes cited as a reason to use Bayesian methods. This reflects two misunderstandings: First, frequentist methods can indeed incorporate constraints on parameter values. Second, it ignores the crucial question of what the result of the analysis will mean. Bayesian and frequentist measures of uncertainty have similar sounding names but quite different meanings. For instance, Bayesian uncertainties typically involve expectations with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameter , holding the data fixed; frequentist uncertainties typically involve expectations with respect to the distribution of the data, holding the parameter fixed. Bayesian methods, including methods incorporating parameter constraints, require supplementing the constraints with a prior probability distribution for parameter values. This can cause frequentist and Bayesian estimates and their nominal uncertainties to differ substantially, even when the prior is "uninformative." This paper gives simple examples where "uninformative" priors are, in fact, extremely informative, and sketches how to measure how much information the prior adds to the constraint. Bayesian methods can have good frequentist behavior, and a frequentist can use Bayesian methods and quantify the uncertainty by frequentist means-but absent a meaningful prior, Bayesian uncertainty measures lack meaning. The paper ends with brief reflections on practice. 1. Introduction. This paper is primarily about philosophy and interpretation rather than computation. It sketches differences in the assumptions frequentist and Bayesian methods require and differences in meaning between frequentist and Bayesian measures of uncertainty, and recapitulates some well-known (within statistics) connections between frequentist and Bayesian methods that are less well known in the wider uncertainty quantification community. It also addresses the misperception that frequentist methods cannot incorporate constraints on unknown parameters, and flags some circumstances in which frequentists might choose to use Bayesian methods without using Bayesian interpretations of the results. This paper focuses on making inferences about a (possibly infinite-dimensional) vector $\theta$ known to be in the subset $\Theta$ of a Hilbert space H, from observations related to that vector. In examples below, the set $\Theta$ is a "ball" in a norm or seminorm. A one-dimensional special case is to estimate a single, real-valued parameter that is known to be between 0 and 1. Then, the Hilbert space H is the real line, the norm is the absolute value, and the set $\Theta$ is a ball of},

Yet methodologists have warned that $\alpha$ is not an optimal measure of reliability relative to its more general form, McDonald's omega ($\omega$). Among other reasons, that the computation of $\omega$ is not available as an option in many popular statistics programs and requires items loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) have probably hindered more widespread adoption. After a bit of discussion of $\alpha$ versus $\omega$, we illustrate the computation of $\omega$ using two structural equation modeling programs (Mplus and AMOS) and the MBESS package for R. We then describe a macro for SPSS and SAS (OMEGA) that calculates $\omega$ in two ways without relying on the estimation of loadings or error variances using CFA. We show that it produces estimates of $\omega$ that are nearly identical to when using CFA-based estimates of item loadings and error variances. We also discuss the use of the OMEGA macro for certain forms of item analysis and brief form construction based on the removal of items from a longer scale.},

Specifically, using data from an ongoing debate, we show that commonly exercised flexibility at the experimental design and data analysis stages of replication testing can make it appear that a finding was not replicated when, in fact, it was. The debate that we focus on is representative, on key dimensions, of a large number of other replication tests in psychology that have been published in recent years, suggesting that the lessons of this analysis may be far reaching. The problems with current practice in replication science that we uncover here are particularly worrisome because they are not adequately addressed by the field's standard remedies, including preregistration. Implications for how the field could develop more effective methodological standards for replication are discussed.},

abstract = {A recurring methodological problem in the evaluation of the predictive validity of selection methods is that the values of the criterion variable are available for selected applicants only. This so-called range restriction problem causes biased population estimates. Correction methods for direct and indirect range restriction scenarios have widely studied for continuous criterion variables but not for dichotomous ones. The few existing approaches are inapplicable because they do not consider the unknown base rate of success. Hence, there is a lack of scientific research on suitable correction methods and the systematic analysis of their accuracies in the cases of a naturally or artificially dichotomous criterion.We aim to overcome this deficiency by viewing the range restriction problem as a missing data mechanism.We usedmultiple imputation by chained equations to generate complete criterion data before estimating the predictive validity and the base rate of success. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to investigate the accuracy of the proposed correction in dependence of selection ratio, predictive validity, and base rate of success in an experimental design. In addition, we compared our proposed missing data approach with Thorndike's well-known correction formulas that have only been used in the case of continuous criterion variables so far. The results show that themissing data approach is more accurate in estimating the predictive validity than Thorndike's correction formulas. The accuracy of our proposed correction increases as the selection ratio and the correlation between predictor and criterion increase. Furthermore, the missing data approach provides a valid estimate of the unknown base rate of success. On the basis of our findings, we argue for the use ofmultiple imputation by chained equations in the evaluation of the predictive validity of selection methods when the criterion is dichotomous.},

Other methods for estimating missing data scores may be more accurate and preserve more data for investigators to analyze. Further, the literature reveals that the amount of missing data and the reasons for deletion of data impact how investigators should handle the problem.

It uses historical data to measure the likelihood that a name was associated with a particular gender based on the time or place under study. This approach generates more accurate results for sources that encompass changing periods of time, providing digital humanities scholars with a tool to estimate the gender of names across large textual collections. The article first describes the methodology as implemented in the gender package for the R programming language. It goes on to apply the method to a case study in which we examine gender and gatekeeping in the American historical profession over the past half-century.

Claims that women scientists suffer discrimination in these arenas rest on a set of studies undergirding policies and programs aimed at remediation. More recent and robust empiricism, however, fails to support assertions of discrimination in these domains. To better understand women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields and its causes, we reprise claims of discrimination and their evidentiary bases. Based on a review of the past 20 y of data, we suggest that some of these claims are no longer valid and, if uncritically accepted as current causes of women's lack of progress, can delay or prevent understanding of contemporary determinants of women's underrepresentation. We conclude that differential gendered outcomes in the real world result from differences in resources attributable to choices, whether free or constrained, and that such choices could be influenced and better informed through education if resources were so directed. Thus, the ongoing focus on sex discrimination in reviewing, interviewing, and hiring represents costly, misplaced effort: Society is engaged in the present in solving problems of the past, rather than in addressing meaningful limitations deterring women's participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers today. Addressing today's causes of underrepresentation requires focusing on education and policy changes that will make institutions responsive to differing biological realities of the sexes. Finally, we suggest potential avenues of intervention to increase gender fairness that accord with current, as opposed to historical, findings.},

Gender classification, a two-class problem (male or female), has been the subject of extensive research recently and gained a lot of attention due to its varied set of applications. The proposed work relies on individual facial features to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for gender classification. In contrast with previously reported results that assume the facial features are independent, we consider the facial features as correlated features by training a single CNN that jointly learns from all facial features. In terms of accuracy, our results either outperform, or are on par with, other gender classification techniques applied to three different datasets namely specs on faces, groups, and face recognition technology. In terms of performance, the proposed CNN has significantly fewer parameters as compared with other techniques reported in the literature. Our learnable parameters are fewer than those required in techniques reported in recent work, which enables them to make the network less sensitive to over-fitting and easier to train than techniques that use different CNNs for each facial feature as reported in the literature.},

However, an inherent characteristic of forward citations is that they take time to accumulate. This makes them valuable for retrospective impact evaluations, but less helpful for prospective forecasting exercises. To overcome this, it would be desirable to have indicators that forecast future citations at the time a patent is issued. In this paper, we outline one such indicator, based on the size of the inventor teams associated with patents. We demonstrate that, on average, patents with eight or more co-inventors are cited significantly more frequently in their first 5 years than peer patents with fewer inventors. This result holds true across technologies, assignee type, citation source (examiner versus applicant), and after self-citations are accounted for. We hypothesize that inventor team size may be a reflection of the amount of resources committed by an organization to a given innovation, with more researchers attached to innovations regarded as having particular promise or value.},

However, a large-scale analysis based on over eight million papers across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities reveals a number of understated and persistent ways in which gender inequities remain. For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions. Moreover, women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers. Academics should be aware of the subtle ways that gender disparities can occur in scholarly authorship. {\textcopyright} 2013 West et al.},

In assessing technology compatibility, patent analysis can provide insights into the fit between the patent portfolios of the acquiring company and its acquisition target. Having established the technological quality and compatibility of a target company, patent analysis can be used to assess whether the stock market appears to be valuing it fairly. In addition, these methods can be used to identify undervalued companies in which to invest. and for competitive intelligence applications.

Women earn less than men in comparable positions, progress more slowly through academic ranks, and have not attained important leadership roles. This study tested hypotheses about why gender disparities exist in salary, rank, track, leadership, and perceptions of campus climate at one academic center, the University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson. Method. Salary, rank, and track data were obtained from institutional databases for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. A structured, online questionnaire was made available to 418 faculty members to collect information about their goals, attitudes, and experiences. Results. A total of 198 faculty members completed the questionnaire. The data showed significant gender differences in faculty salaries, ranks, tracks, leadership positions, resources, and perceptions of academic climate. On average, women earned {\$}12,777 or 11{\%} less than men, after adjusting for rank, track, degree, specialty, years in rank, and administrative positions (p {\textless} .0003). Of female faculty, 62{\%} were assistant professors (49{\%} of women were non-tenure-eligible assistant professors), while 55{\%} of male faculty were promoted and tenured. Almost a third of women reported being discriminated against, compared with only 5{\%} of men (p {\textless} .00001). Conclusion. Substantial gender differences in the rewards and opportunities of academic medicine remain, that can not be attributed to differences in productivity or committment between women and men.},

abstract = {In 2002, an international survey on reading graphs and tables of rates and percentages was conducted by the W. M. Keck Statistical Literacy Project. Respondents included US college students, college teachers worldwide and professional data analysts in the US and in South Africa. The survey focused on reading informal statistics-rates and percentages in tables and graphs. Some high error rates were encountered. In reading a 100{\%} row table, 44{\%} of students misread a description of a single percentage. In reading a pie chart, 53{\%} of data analysts misread a comparison of two slices. In reading an X-Y plot, 81{\%} of college teachers misread a "times more than" comparison. When asked if a Simpson's Paradox reversal was possible in an observational study, almost half of each group-students, data analysts and college teachers-disagreed. But helping students learn these skills takes considerable time. A new on-line tool has been developed to help students practice using ordinary English to describe and compare rates and percentages. This tool decreased the class time necessary to teach this skill and helped make it possible to teach statistical literacy online. Statistical educators now have both the rules and the tools to teach students how to read and interpret summary data. To avoid being charged with educational negligence, statistical educators should accept responsibility for establishing the grammatical rules for writing ordinary English descriptions and comparisons of rates and percentages and for teaching students to read and write such statements correctly.},

Statistical literacy is portrayed as the ability to interpret, critically evaluate, and communicate about statistical information and messages.

@misc{Oberauer2019,
abstract = {A worrying number of psychological findings are not replicable. Diagnoses of the causes of this “replication crisis,” and recommendations to address it, have nearly exclusively focused on methods of data collection, analysis, and reporting. We argue that a further cause of poor replicability is the often weak logical link between theories and their empirical tests. We propose a distinction between discovery-oriented and theory-testing research. In discovery-oriented research, theories do not strongly imply hypotheses by which they can be tested, but rather define a search space for the discovery of effects that would support them. Failures to find these effects do not question the theory. This endeavor necessarily engenders a high risk of Type I errors—that is, publication of findings that will not replicate. Theory-testing research, by contrast, relies on theories that strongly imply hypotheses, such that disconfirmation of the hypothesis provides evidence against the theory. Theory-testing research engenders a smaller risk of Type I errors. A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models. We critically revisit recommendations for addressing the “replication crisis,” including the proposal to distinguish exploratory from confirmatory research, and the preregistration of hypotheses and analysis plans.},

abstract = {Audits of tenure-track hiring reveal faculty prefer to hire female applicants over males. However, audit data do not control for applicant quality, allowing some to argue women are hired at higher rates because they are more qualified. To test this, Williams and Ceci (2015) conducted an experiment demonstrating a preference for hiring women over identically-qualified men. While their findings are consistent with audits, they raise the specter that faculty may prefer women over even more-qualified men, a claim made recently. We evaluated this claim in the present study: 158 faculty ranked two men and one woman for a tenure-track-assistant professorship, and 94 faculty ranked two women and one man. In the former condition, the female applicant was slightly weaker than her two male competitors, although still strong; in the other condition the male applicant was slightly weaker than his two female competitors, although still strong. Faculty of both genders and in all fields preferred the more-qualified men over the slightly-less-qualified women, and they also preferred the stronger women over the slightly-less-qualified man. This suggests that preference for women among identically-qualified applicants found in experimental studies and in audits does not extend to women whose credentials are even slightly weaker than male counterparts. Thus these data give no support to the twin claims that weaker males are chosen over stronger females or weaker females are hired over stronger males.},

The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies.

Replicability varies between 12 (57{\%}) and 14 (67{\%}) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true-positive rate is 67{\%} in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71{\%}, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility. Furthermore, we find that peer beliefs of replicability are strongly related to replicability, suggesting that the research community could predict which results would replicate and that failures to replicate were not the result of chance alone.},

However, it is neither logically nor statistically correct to conclude an effect is absent when a hypothesis test is not significant. We present two methods to evaluate the presence or absence of effects: Equivalence testing (based on frequentist statistics) and Bayes factors (based on Bayesian statistics). In four examples from the gerontology literature, we illustrate different ways to specify alternative models that can be used to reject the presence of a meaningful or predicted effect in hypothesis tests. We provide detailed explanations of how to calculate, report, and interpret Bayes factors and equivalence tests. We also discuss how to design informative studies that can provide support for a null model or for the absence of a meaningful effect. The conceptual differences between Bayes factors and equivalence tests are discussed, and we also note when and why they might lead to similar or different inferences in practice. It is important that researchers are able to falsify predictions or can quantify the support for predicted null effects. Bayes factors and equivalence tests provide useful statistical tools to improve inferences about null effects.},

This research argues that factor indeterminacy is uncertainty. Factor indeterminacy fundamentally threatens the validity of psychometric measurement, because it blurs the linkage between a common factor and the conceptual variable that the factor represents. Acknowledging and quantifying factor indeterminacy is important for progress in reducing this component of uncertainty in measurement, and thus improving psychological measurement over time.

We argue that a large part of the problem is the lack of a cumulative theoretical framework or frameworks. Without an overarching theoretical framework that generates hypotheses across diverse domains, empirical programs spawn and grow from personal intuitions and culturally biased folk theories. By providing ways to develop clear predictions, including through the use of formal modelling, theoretical frameworks set expectations that determine whether a new finding is confirmatory, nicely integrating with existing lines of research, or surprising, and therefore requiring further replication and scrutiny. Such frameworks also prioritize certain research foci, motivate the use diverse empirical approaches and, often, provide a natural means to integrate across the sciences. Thus, overarching theoretical frameworks pave the way toward a more general theory of human behaviour. We illustrate one such a theoretical framework: dual inheritance theory.},

However, researchers who conduct a replication and want to statistically combine the results of their replication with a statistically significant original study encounter problems when using traditional meta-analysis techniques. The original study's effect size is most probably overestimated because it is statistically significant, and this bias is not taken into consideration in traditional meta-analysis. We have developed a hybrid method that does take the statistical significance of an original study into account and enables (a) accurate effect size estimation, (b) estimation of a confidence interval, and (c) testing of the null hypothesis of no effect. We analytically approximate the performance of the hybrid method and describe its statistical properties. By applying the hybrid method to data from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we demonstrate that the conclusions based on the hybrid method are often in line with those of the replication, suggesting that many published psychological studies have smaller effect sizes than those reported in the original study, and that some effects may even be absent. We offer hands-on guidelines for how to statistically combine an original study and replication, and have developed a Web-based application (https://rvanaert.shinyapps.io/hybrid) for applying the hybrid method.},

abstract = {We provide a basic review of the data screening and assumption testing issues relevant to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis along with practical advice for conducting analyses that are sensitive to these concerns. Historically, factor analysis was developed for explaining the relationships among many continuous test scores, which led to the expression of the common factor model as a multivariate linear regression model with observed, continuous variables serving as dependent variables, and unobserved factors as the independent, explanatory variables. Thus, we begin our paper with a review of the assumptions for the common factor model and data screening issues as they pertain to the factor analysis of continuous observed variables. In particular, we describe how prin- ciples from regression diagnostics also apply to factor analysis. Next, because modern applications of factor analysis frequently involve the analysis of the individual items from a single test or questionnaire, an important focus of this paper is the factor analysis of items. Although the traditional linear factor model is well-suited to the analysis of con- tinuously distributed variables, commonly used item types, including Likert-type items, almost always produce dichotomous or ordered categorical variables. We describe how relationships among such items are often not well described by product-moment correla- tions, which has clear ramifications for the traditional linear factor analysis. An alternative, non-linear factor analysis using polychoric correlations has become more readily available to applied researchers and thus more popular. Consequently, we also review the assumptions and data-screening issues involved in this method.Throughout the paper, we demonstrate these procedures using an historic data set of nine cognitive ability variables. {\textcopyright} 2012 Flora, LaBrish and Chalmers.},

The current (biased) implementation for the RMSEA never rejects that a model fits closely when data are binary and almost invariably rejects the model in large samples if data consist of five categories. The unbiased RMSEA produces better rejection rates, but it is only accurate enough when the number of variables is small and the degree of misfit is small. In contrast, across all simulated conditions, the tests of close fit based on the SRMR yield acceptable type I error rates. SRMR tests of close fit are also more powerful than those using the unbiased RMSEA.},

Traditionally, the evaluation of measurement invariance (MI) involves comparing independent groups defined by a single categorical covariate (e.g., men and women) to determine if there are any items that display differential item functioning (DIF). More recently, Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) has been advanced as an approach for evaluating MI/DIF simultaneously over multiple background variables, categorical and continuous. Unfortunately, conventional procedures for detecting DIF do not scale well to the more complex MNLFA. The current manuscript therefore proposes a regularization approach to MNLFA estimation that penalizes the likelihood for DIF parameters (i.e., rewarding sparse DIF). This procedure avoids the pitfalls of sequential inference tests, is automated for end users, and is shown to perform well in both a small-scale simulation and an empirical validation study.},

Thus knowing how structural misspecifications affect a factor loading is a key issue. This paper develops analytic conditions of when misspecifications affect Bollen's (1996) model implied instrumental variable, two stage least squares (MIIV-2SLS) estimator of a factor loading. It shows that if an indicator equation is correctly specified, then correlated errors among other measures, mixing up causal indicators with reflective, omitting cross loadings, and omitting direct effects between indicators leave the MIIV-2SLS estimator of the factor loading unchanged. Alternatively, if the indicator or the scaling indicator equation is misspecified, then the loading is unlikely to be robust. The results are illustrated with hypothetical and empirical examples.},

There is, however, concern that rewarding scientists chiefly on publication creates a perverse incentive, allowing careless and fraudulent conduct to thrive, compounded by the predisposition of top-tier journals towards novel, positive findings rather than investigations confirming null hypothesis. This potentially compounds a reproducibility crisis in several fields, and risks undermining science and public trust in scientific findings. To date, there has been comparatively little modelling on factors that influence science trustworthiness, despite the importance of quantifying the problem. We present a simple phenomenological model with cohorts of diligent, careless and unethical scientists, with funding allocated by published outputs. This analysis suggests that trustworthiness of published science in a given field is influenced by false positive rate, and pressures for positive results. We find decreasing available funding has negative consequences for resulting trustworthiness, and examine strategies to combat propagation of irreproducible science.},

Publication bias in favor of positive findings influences the distribution of published results. We find that unless a sufficient fraction of negative results are published, false claims frequently can become canonized as fact. Data-dredging, p-hacking, and similar behaviors exacerbate the problem. Should negative results become easier to publish as a claim approaches acceptance as a fact, however, true and false claims would be more readily distinguished.

abstract = {RMSEA estimation given nonnormal continuous data is usually based on the mean-adjusted (TM) or mean-variance-adjusted (TMV) chi-square statistic, but a plain application of these statistics has poor performance. Savalei and colleagues gave a better way (the BSL method) to infer RMSEA using TMor TMV. However, the BSL method is applicable to continuous data only. For categorical data, currently RMSEA inference is still based on a plain application of TMor TMV, but such practice is already problematic under continuous data. In this paper, we first show that it is more meaningful to define RMSEA under unweighted least squares (ULS) than under weighted least squares (WLS) or diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS). Then, we propose a correct point estimator and confidence interval for RMSEA given categorical data and ULS. Simulation results show our methods perform well while all the traditional methods break down.},

abstract = {We propose a Corrected Goodness-of-Fit Index (CGFI) for model evaluation in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The CGFI is essentially a corrected index that takes into account model complexity and downward bias caused by small sample size. Using simulations based on pre-set SEM models, we compared the properties of CGFI, Goodness-of-Fit (GFI), and Adjusted Goodness-of-Fit Index (AGFI) under different settings of sample size, estimation method, magnitude of factor loadings, model complexity, and types and degrees of model misspecification. We find that the CGFI is more stable across different sample sizes and much more sensitive to detect model misspecification than the GFI and AGFI. We recommend a critical value of 0.90 for the proposed CGFI to evaluate the goodness of fit of SEM. Our proposed CGFI is easy to implement and can serve as a useful supplementary fit index to existing ones.},

In the case of two factors, three separate null hypotheses are subject to test (i.e., two main effects and one interaction). Consequently, the probability of at least one Type I error (if all null hypotheses are true) is 14 {\%} rather than 5 {\%}, if the three tests are independent. We explain the multiple-comparison problem and demonstrate that researchers almost never correct for it. To mitigate the problem, we describe four remedies: the omnibus F test, control of the familywise error rate, control of the false discovery rate, and preregistration of the hypotheses.},

abstract = {The movement towards open science is a consequence of seemingly pervasive failures to replicate previous research. This transition comes with great benefits but also significant challenges that are likely to affect those who carry out the research, usually early career researchers (ECRs). Here, we describe key benefits, including reputational gains, increased chances of publication, and a broader increase in the reliability of research. The increased chances of publication are supported by exploratory analyses indicating null findings are substantially more likely to be published via open registered reports in comparison to more conventional methods. These benefits are balanced by challenges that we have encountered and that involve increased costs in terms of flexibility, time, and issues with the current incentive structure, all of which seem to affect ECRs acutely. Although there are major obstacles to the early adoption of open science, overall open science practices should benefit both the ECR and improve the quality of research. We review 3 benefits and 3 challenges and provide suggestions from the perspective of ECRs for moving towards open science practices, which we believe scientists and institutions at all levels would do well to consider.},

abstract = {Researchers have devoted some time and effort to developing methods for fitting nonlinear relationships among latent variables. In particular, most of these have focused on correctly modeling interactions between 2 exogenous latent variables, and quadratic relationships between exogenous and endogenous variables. All of these approaches require prespecification of the nonlinearity by the researcher, and are limited to fairly simple nonlinear relationships. Other work has been done using mixture structural equation models (SEMM) in an attempt to fit more complex nonlinear relationships. This study expands on this earlier work by introducing the 2-stage generalized additive model (2SGAM) approach for fitting regression splines in the context of structural equation models. The model is first described and then investigated through the use of simulated data, in which it was compared with the SEMM approach. Results demonstrate that the 2SGAM is an effective tool for fitting a variety of nonlinear relationships between latent variables, and can be easily and accurately extended to models including multiple latent variables. Implications of these results are discussed.},

abstract = {Psychology is undergoing a replication crisis. The discussion surrounding this crisis has centered on mistrust of previous findings. Researchers planning replication studies often use the original study sample effect size as the basis for sample size planning. However, this strategy ignores uncertainty and publication bias in estimated effect sizes, resulting in overly optimistic calculations. A psychologist who intends to obtain power of.80 in the replication study, and performs calculations accordingly, may have an actual power lower than.80. We performed simulations to reveal the magnitude of the difference between actual and intended power based on common sample size planning strategies and assessed the performance of methods that aim to correct for effect size uncertainty and/or bias. Our results imply that even if original studies reflect actual phenomena and were conducted in the absence of questionable research practices, popular approaches to designing replication studies may result in a low success rate, especially if the original study is underpowered. Methods correcting for bias and/or uncertainty generally had higher actual power, but were not a panacea for an underpowered original study. Thus, it becomes imperative that 1) original studies are adequately powered and 2) replication studies are designed with methods that are more likely to yield the intended level of power.},

Smoking patterns were obtained from questionnaire data and disease-related clinical and laboratory data were compared between current, past, ever, and never smokers.RESULTS: Current smoking rates were 4.6{\%} for SS patients compared to 14.1{\%} in non-SS sicca (p = 5.17x10E-09), 18{\%} in a local lupus cohort (p = 1.13x10E-14) and 16.8{\%} in the community (p = 4.12x10E-15). Current smoking was protective against SS classification (OR 0.35, 95{\%}CI 0.22-0.56, FDR q = 1.9E10-05), focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (OR 0.26, 95{\%}CI 0.15-0.44, FDR q = 1.52x10E-06), focus score ≥1 (OR 0.22, 95{\%}CI 0.13-0.39, FDR q = 1.43x10E-07), and anti-Ro/SSA(+) (OR 0.36, 95{\%}CI 0.2-0.64, FDR q = 0.0009); ever smoking was protective against the same features and against anti-La/SSB(+) (OR 0.52, 95{\%}CI 0.39-0.70, FDR q = 5.82x10E-05). Duration of smoking was inversely correlated with SS even after controlling for socioeconomic status, BMI, alcohol and caffeine consumption.CONCLUSIONS: Current tobacco smoking is negatively and independently associated with SS, protecting against disease-associated humoral and cellular autoimmunity. The overall smoking rate amongst SS patients is significantly lower than in matched populations and the effects of smoking are proportional to exposure duration. In spite of the protective effects of tobacco on SS manifestations, it is associated with other serious comorbidities such as lung disease, cardiovascular risk and malignancy, and should thus be strongly discouraged in patients with sicca.},

abstract = {Objective: In recent years, vitamin D has been shown to possess a wide range of immunomodulatory effects. Although there is extensive amount of research on vitamin D, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency or the mechanism by which vitamin D regulates the human immune system. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of vitamin D deficiency and the relationship between vitamin D and the immune system in healthy individuals. Methods: Healthy individuals (n = 774) comprised of European-Americans (EA, n = 470), African Americans (AA, n = 125), and Native Americans (NA, n = 179) were screened for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels by ELISA. To identify the most noticeable effects of vitamin D on the immune system, 20 EA individuals with severely deficient ({\textless}11.3 ng/mL) and sufficient ({\textgreater}24.8 ng/mL) vitamin D levels were matched and selected for further analysis. Serum cytokine level measurement, immune cell phenotyping, and phosphoflow cytometry were performed. Results: Vitamin D sufficiency was observed in 37.5{\%} of the study cohort. By multivariate analysis, AA, NA, and females with a high body mass index (BMI, {\textgreater}30) demonstrate higher rates of vitamin D deficiency (p,0.05). Individuals with vitamin D deficiency had significantly higher levels of serum GM-CSF (p = 0.04), decreased circulating activated CD4+ (p = 0.04) and CD8+ T (p = 0.04) cell frequencies than individuals with sufficient vitamin D levels. Conclusion: A large portion of healthy individuals have vitamin D deficiency. These individuals have altered T and B cell responses, indicating that the absence of sufficient vitamin D levels could result in undesirable cellular and molecular alterations ultimately contributing to immune dysregulation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ritterhouse et al.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited. Objectives The relationship of immune dysregulation and autoantibody production that may contribute to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis is unknown. This study evaluates the individual and combined contributions of autoantibodies, type I interferon (IFN-$\alpha$) activity, and IFN-associated soluble mediators to disease development leading to SLE. Methods Serial serum specimens from 55 individuals collected prior to SLE classification (average timespan=4.3a €...years) and unaffected healthy controls matched by age (±5a €...years), gender, race and time of sample procurement were obtained from the Department of Defense Serum Repository. Levels of serum IFN-$\alpha$ activity, IFN-associated mediators and autoantibodies were evaluated and temporal relationships assessed by growth curve modelling, path analysis, analysis of covariance and random forest models. Results In cases, but not matched controls, autoantibody specificities and IFN-associated mediators accumulated over a period of years, plateauing near the time of disease classification (p{\textless}0.001). Autoantibody positivity coincided with or followed type II IFN dysregulation, preceding IFN-$\alpha$ activity in growth curve models, with elevated IFN-$\alpha$ activity and B-lymphocyte stimulator levels occurring shortly before SLE classification (p≤0.005). Cases were distinguished by multivariate random forest models incorporating IFN- 3, macrophage chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3, anti-chromatin and anti-spliceosome antibodies (accuracy 93{\%} {\textgreater}4a €...years pre-classification; 97{\%} within 2a €...years of SLE classification). Conclusions Years before SLE classification, enhancement of the type II IFN pathway allows for accumulation of autoantibodies and subsequent elevations in IFN-$\alpha$ activity immediately preceding SLE classification. Perturbations in select immunological processes may help identify at-risk individuals for further clinical evaluation or participation in prospective intervention trials.},

We sought to extend the previously reported association of pathogenic soluble mediators and autoantibodies with mouse Mda5 to its human ortholog, IFIH1. To better understand the role this gene plays in human lupus, we assessed association of IFIH1 variants with soluble mediators and autoantibodies in 357 European-American SLE patients, first-degree relatives, and unrelated, unaffected healthy controls. Association between each of 135 genotyped SNPs in IFIH1 and four lupus-associated plasma mediators, IL-6, TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\beta$, and IP-10, were investigated via linear regression. No significant associations were found to SNPs orthologous to those identified in exon 13 of the mouse. However, outside of this region there were significant associations between IL-6 and rs76162067 (p = 0.008), as well as IP-10 and rs79711023 (p = 0.003), located in a region of IFIH1 previously shown to directly influence MDA-5 mediated IP-10 and IL-6 secretion. SLE patients and FDRs carrying the minor allele for rs79711023 demonstrated lower levels of IP-10, while only FDRs carrying the minor allele for rs76162067 demonstrated an increased level of IL-6. This would suggest that the change in IP-10 is genotypically driven, while the change in IL-6 may be reflective of SLE transition status. These data suggest that IFIH1 may contribute to SLE pathogenesis via altered inflammatory mechanisms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with a poorly understood preclinical stage of immune dysregulation and symptom accrual. Accumulation of antinuclear autoantibody (ANA) specificities is a hallmark of impending clinical disease. Yet, many ANA-positive individuals remain healthy, suggesting that additional immune dysregulation underlies SLE pathogenesis. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that interferon (IFN) pathways are dysregulated in preclinical SLE. To determine if other forms of immune dysregulation contribute to preclinical SLE pathogenesis, we measured SLE-associated autoantibodies and soluble mediators in samples from 84 individuals collected prior to SLE classification (average timespan = 5.98 years), compared to unaffected, healthy control samples matched by race, gender, age (±5 years), and time of sample procurement. We found that multiple soluble mediators, including interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, and IFN-$\gamma$, were significantly elevated in cases compared to controls more than 3.5 years pre-classification, prior to or concurrent with autoantibody positivity. Additional mediators, including innate cytokines, IFN-associated chemokines, and soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily mediators increased longitudinally in cases approaching SLE classification, but not in controls. In particular, levels of B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) were comparable in cases and controls until less than 10 months pre-classification. Over the entire pre-classification period, random forest models incorporating ANA and anti-Ro/SSA positivity with levels of IL-5, IL-6, and the IFN-$\gamma$-induced chemokine, MIG, distinguished future SLE patients with 92{\%} (±1.8{\%}) accuracy, compared to 78{\%} accuracy utilizing ANA positivity alone. These data suggest that immune dysregulation involving multiple pathways contributes to SLE pathogenesis. Importantly, distinct immunological profiles are predictive for individuals who will develop clinical SLE and may be useful for delineating early pathogenesis, discovering therapeutic targets, and designing prevention trials.},

Summated rating scales are ubiquitous in organizational research, and there are well-delineated guidelines for scale development (e.g., Hinkin, 1998). Nevertheless, there has been less research on the explicit selection of the response anchors. Constructing survey questions with equal-interval properties (i.e., interval or ratio data) is important if researchers plan to analyze their data using parametric statistics. As such, the primary objectives of the current study were to (a) determine the most common contexts in which summated rating scales are used (e.g., agreement, similarity, frequency, amount, and judgment), (b) determine the most commonly used anchors (e.g., strongly disagree, often, very good), and (c) provide empirical data on the conceptual distance between these anchors. We present the mean and standard deviation of scores for estimates of each anchor and the percentage of distribution overlap between the anchors. Our results provide researchers with data that can be used to guide the selection of verbal anchors with equal-interval properties so as to reduce measurement error and improve confidence in the results of subsequent analyses. We also conducted multiple empirical studies to examine the consequences of measuring constructs with unequal-interval anchors. A clear pattern of results is that correlations involving unequal-interval anchors are consistently weaker than correlations involving equal-interval anchors.},

Subsequently, Li developed a Case IV correction, which seeks to estimate group differences on a predictor using only incumbent data but must assume that group membership (e.g., ethnicity) plays no role in selection decisions. In this paper, we extend Li's correction and relax this assumption. In addition, this new correction allows for the estimation of subgroup differences on both the criterion and predictor. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we study the performance of both estimators under situations where Li's assumptions are violated and demonstrate that this new procedure almost always outperforms Li's Case IV correction and does so with greater precision.

abstract = {The WITNESS model (Clark in Applied Cognitive Psychology 17:629-654, 2003) provides a theoretical framework with which to investigate the factors that contribute to eyewitness identification decisions. One key factor involves the contributions of absolute versus relative judgments. An absolute contribution is determined by the degree of match between an individual lineup member and memory for the perpetrator; a relative contribution involves the degree to which the best-matching lineup member is a better match to memory than the remaining lineup members. In WITNESS, the proportional contributions of relative versus absolute judgments are governed by the values of the decision weight parameters. We conducted an exploration of the WITNESS model's parameter space to determine the identifiability of these relative/absolute decision weight parameters, and compared the results to a restricted version of the model that does not vary the decision weight parameters. This exploration revealed that the decision weights in WITNESS are difficult to identify: Data often can be fit equally well by setting the decision weights to nearly any value and compensating with a criterion adjustment. Clark, Erickson, and Breneman (Law and Human Behavior 35:364-380, 2011) claimed to demonstrate a theoretical basis for the superiority of lineup decisions that are based on absolute contributions, but the relationship between the decision weights and the criterion weakens this claim. These findings necessitate reconsidering the role of the relative/absolute judgment distinction in eyewitness decision making. {\textcopyright} 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

In this article, we compare Case IV to two other comparable procedures: the first correction (the expectation maximization algorithm) requires raw data about the selection variables used to form a suitability judgment. The second, the Pearson-Lawley correction, requires the variance-covariance matrix of the selection variables. We show that even when the variables used for selection are unobserved or unavailable, it is still possible to estimate parameters without making the restrictive assumptions of Case IV.

If the selection variable was measured and is available, the data are regarded as missing at random (MAR). Selection biases correlation, reliability, and effect size estimates when these estimates are computed on listwise deleted (LD) data sets. On the other hand, maximum likelihood (ML) estimates are generally unbiased and outperform LD in most situations, at least when the data are MAR. The exception is when we estimate the partial correlation. In this situation, LD estimates are unbiased when the cause of missingness is partialled out. In other words, there is no advantage of ML estimates over LD estimates in this situation. We demonstrate that under a MAR condition, even ML estimates may become biased, depending on how partial correlations are computed. Finally, we conclude with recommendations about how future researchers might estimate partial correlations even when the cause of missingness is unknown and, perhaps, unknowable.},

abstract = {Recently there has been a growing concern that many published research findings do not hold up in attempts to replicate them. We argue that this problem may originate from a culture of ‘you can publish if you found a significant effect'. This culture creates a systematic bias against the null hypothesis which renders meta-analyses questionable and may even lead to a situation where hypotheses become difficult to falsify. In order to pinpoint the sources of error and possible solutions, we review current scientific practices with regard to their effect on the probability of drawing a false-positive conclusion. We explain why the proportion of published false-positive findings is expected to increase with (i) decreasing sample size, (ii) increasing pursuit of novelty, (iii) various forms of multiple testing and researcher flexibility, and (iv) incorrect P-values, especially due to unaccounted pseudoreplication, i.e. the non-independence of data points (clustered data). We provide examples showing how statistical pitfalls and psychological traps lead to conclusions that are biased and unreliable, and we show how these mistakes can be avoided. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to a culture of ‘you can publish if your study is rigorous'. To this end, we highlight promising strategies towards making science more objective. Specifically, we enthusiastically encourage scientists to preregister their studies (including a priori hypotheses and complete analysis plans), to blind observers to treatment groups during data collection and analysis, and unconditionally to report all results. Also, we advocate reallocating some efforts away from seeking novelty and discovery and towards replicating important research findings of one's own and of others for the benefit of the scientific community as a whole. We believe these efforts will be aided by a shift in evaluation criteria away from the current system which values metrics of ‘impact' almost exclusively and towards a system which explicitly values indices of scientific rigour.},

We consider its implications for power analyses, the precision of estimated effects, and the planning of original and replication research. With heterogeneity and an interest in generalizing to a population of studies, the usual power calculations and confidence intervals are likely misleading, and the preference for single definitive large-N studies is misguided.

Researchers planning replication studies often use the original study sample effect size as the basis for sample size planning. However, this strategy ignores uncertainty and publication bias in estimated effect sizes, resulting in overly optimistic calculations. A psychologist who intends to obtain power of.80 in the replication study, and performs calculations accordingly, may have an actual power lower than.80. We performed simulations to reveal the magnitude of the difference between actual and intended power based on common sample size planning strategies and assessed the performance of methods that aim to correct for effect size uncertainty and/or bias. Our results imply that even if original studies reflect actual phenomena and were conducted in the absence of questionable research practices, popular approaches to designing replication studies may result in a low success rate, especially if the original study is underpowered. Methods correcting for bias and/or uncertainty generally had higher actual power, but were not a panacea for an underpowered original study. Thus, it becomes imperative that 1) original studies are adequately powered and 2) replication studies are designed with methods that are more likely to yield the intended level of power.},

abstract = {In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention to reproducibility. For example, the Reproducibility Project, a large-scale replication attempt of 100 studies published in top psychology journals found that only 39{\%} could be unambiguously reproduced. There is a growing consensus among scientists that the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems from various methodological factors, including low statistical power, researcher's degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a contentious debate about the extent to which failures to reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual differences (often termed "hiddenmoderators") between the original research and the replication attempt. Although psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is unlikely to influence the results of direct replications precisely because these studies use the same methods as those used in the original research. To help resolve this debate, we recoded the 100 original studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent to which the research topic of each study was contextually sensitive. Results suggested that the contextual sensitivity of the research topic was associated with replication success, even after statistically adjusting for several methodological characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The association between contextual sensitivity and replication success did not differ across psychological subdisciplines. These results suggest that researchers, replicators, and consumers should bemindful of contextual factors that might influence a psychological process. We offer several guidelines for dealing with contextual sensitivity in reproducibility.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to discuss the application of the Random Forest methodology to sensory analysis. A methodological point of view is mainly adopted to describe as simply as possible the construction of binary decision trees and, more precisely, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), as well as the generation of an ensemble of trees or, in other words, a Random Forest. The interest of the permutation accuracy criterion, as a measure of variable importance, is specifically emphasized as a way of identifying the most predictive variables and selecting a subset of these variables for parsimonious and efficient predictive models. A two-step procedure is proposed for choosing this subset of variables. The principle of the method is illustrated in a case study in which the aim was to better understand and predict the olfactory characteristics of red wines made of the Cabernet Franc grape variety, from their Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) content. For two main olfactory attributes, the bell pepper odor and the leather odor, it was possible to list the most important compounds and to highlight a very small number of compounds useful for estimating each of the olfactory attributes considered. For the latter, it was also observed that Random Forest models had a better predictive ability than Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression models.},

abstract = {Structural equation model (SEM) trees, a combination of SEMs and decision trees, have been proposed as a data-analytic tool for theory-guided exploration of empirical data. With respect to a hypothesized model of multivariate outcomes, such trees recursively find subgroups with similar patterns of observed data. SEM trees allow for the automatic selection of variables that predict differences across individuals in specific theoretical models, for instance, differences in latent factor profiles or developmental trajectories. However, SEM trees are unstable when small variations in the data can result in different trees. As a remedy, SEM forests, which are ensembles of SEM trees based on resamplings of the original dataset, provide increased stability. Because large forests are less suitable for visual inspection and interpretation, aggregate measures provide researchers with hints on how to improve their models: (a) variable importance is based on random permutations of the out-of-bag (OOB) samples of the individual trees and quantifies, for each variable, the average reduction of uncertainty about the model-predicted distribution; and (b) case proximity enables researchers to perform clustering and outlier detection. We provide an overview of SEM forests and illustrate their utility in the context of cross-sectional factor models of intelligence and episodic memory. We discuss benefits and limitations, and provide advice on how and when to use SEM trees and forests in future research.},

abstract = {Data mining of treatment study results can reveal unforeseen but critical insights, such as who receives the most benefit from treatment and under what circumstances. The usefulness and legitimacy of exploratory data analysis have received relatively little recognition, however, and analytic methods well suited to the task are not widely known in psychology. With roots in computer science and statistics, statistical learning approaches offer a credible option: These methods take a more inductive approach to building a model than is done in traditional regression, allowing the data greater role in suggesting the correct relationships between variables rather than imposing them a priori. Classification and regression trees are presented as a powerful, flexible exemplar of statistical learning methods. Trees allow researchers to efficiently identify useful predictors of an outcome and discover interactions between predictors without the need to anticipate and specify these in advance, making them ideal for revealing patterns that inform hypotheses about treatment effects. Trees can also provide a predictive model for forecasting outcomes as an aid to clinical decision making. This primer describes how tree models are constructed, how the results are interpreted and evaluated, and how trees overcome some of the complexities of traditional regression. Examples are drawn from randomized clinical trial data and highlight some interpretations of particular interest to treatment researchers. The limitations of tree models are discussed, and suggestions for further reading and choices in software are offered.},

abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has been the subject of debate for decades and alternative approaches to data analysis have been proposed. This article addresses this debate from the perspective of scientific inquiry and inference. Inference is an inverse problem and application of statistical methods cannot reveal whether effects exist or whether they are empirically meaningful. Hence, raising conclusions from the outcomes of statistical analyses is subject to limitations. NHST has been criticized for its misuse and the misconstruction of its outcomes, also stressing its inability to meet expectations that it was never designed to fulfil. Ironically, alternatives to NHST are identical in these respects, something that has been overlooked in their presentation. Three of those alternatives are discussed here (estimation via confidence intervals and effect sizes, quantification of evidence via Bayes factors, and mere reporting of descriptive statistics). None of them offers a solution to the problems that NHST is purported to have, all of them are susceptible to misuse and misinterpretation, and some bring around their own problems (e.g., Bayes factors have a one-to-one correspondence with p values, but they are entirely deprived of an inferential framework). Those alternatives also fail to cover a broad area of inference not involving distributional parameters, where NHST procedures remain the only (and suitable) option. Like knives or axes, NHST is not inherently evil; only misuse and misinterpretation of its outcomes needs to be eradicated.},

Although statistically significant results were reported in 97{\%} of the original studies, statistical significance was achieved in only 36{\%} of the replicated studies. This article presents a reanalysis of these data based on a formal statistical model that accounts for publication bias by treating outcomes from unpublished studies as missing data, while simultaneously estimating the distribution of effect sizes for those studies that tested nonnull effects. The resulting model suggests that more than 90{\%} of tests performed in eligible psychology experiments tested negligible effects, and that publication biases based on p-values caused the observed rates of nonreproducibility. The results of this reanalysis provide a compelling argument for both increasing the threshold required for declaring scientific discoveries and for adopting statistical summaries of evidence that account for the high proportion of tested hypotheses that are false.

Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources-the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior. If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity. Academia and federal agencies should better support science as a public good, and incentivize altruistic and ethical outcomes, while de-emphasizing output.},

abstract = {Typical Bayesian methods for models with latent variables (or random effects) involve directly sampling the latent variables along with the model parameters. In high-level software code for model definitions (using, e.g., BUGS, JAGS, Stan), the likelihood is therefore specified as conditional on the latent variables. This can lead researchers to perform model comparisons via conditional likelihoods, where the latent variables are considered model parameters. In other settings, however, typical model comparisons involve marginal likelihoods where the latent variables are integrated out. This distinction is often overlooked despite the fact that it can have a large impact on the comparisons of interest. In this paper, we clarify and illustrate these issues , focusing on the comparison of conditional and marginal Deviance Information Criteria (DICs) and Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAICs) in psychometric modeling. The conditional/marginal distinction corresponds to whether the model should be predictive for the clusters that are in the data or for new clusters (where "clusters" typically correspond to higher-level units like people or schools). Correspondingly, we show that marginal WAIC corresponds to leave-one-cluster out (LOcO) cross-validation, whereas conditional WAIC corresponds to leave-one-unit out (LOuO). These results lead to recommendations on the general application of the criteria to models with latent variables.},

abstract = {Background: Visualisations and readily-accessible web-based supplementary files can improve data reporting and transparency. In this paper, we make use of recent developments in software and psychological network analysis to describe the baseline cohort of a trial testing the Let's Move It intervention, which aimed to increase physical activity (PA) and reduce sedentary behaviours (SB) among vocational school students. Methods: At baseline, 1166 adolescents, distributed across 6 school clusters and four educational tracks, completed measures of PA and SB, theoretical predictors of these behaviours, and body composition. Within a comprehensive website supplement, which includes all code and analyses, data were tabulated and visualised, and network analyses explored relations between predictor variables and outcomes. Results: Average daily moderate-to-vigorous PA was 65 min (CI95: 57min-73 min), and SB 8h44 min (CI95: 8h04min-9h24 min), with 25.8 (CI95: 23.5-28.0) interruptions to sitting. Cluster randomisation appeared to result in balanced distributions for baseline characteristics between intervention and control groups, but differences emerged across the four educational tracks. Self-reported behaviour change technique (BCT) use was low for many but not all techniques. A network analysis revealed direct relationships between PA and behavioural experiments, planning and autonomous motivation, and several BCTs were connected to PA via autonomous motivation. Visualisation uncovered a case of Simpson's paradox. Conclusions: Data-visualisation and data exploration techniques (e.g. network analysis) can help reveal the dynamics involved in complex multi-causal systems-a challenging task with traditional data presentations. The benefits of presenting complex data visually should encourage researchers to publish extensive analyses and descriptions as website supplements, which would increase the},

abstract = {Background: Public Law 102-321 established a block grant for adults with "serious mental illness" (SMI) and required the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to develop a method to estimate the prevalence of SMI. Methods: Three SMI screening scales were developed for possible use in the SAMHSA National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short-Form (CIDI-SF) scale, the K10/K6 nonspecific distress scales, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS). An enriched convenience sample of 155 respondents was administered all screening scales followed by the 12-month Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). We defined SMI as any 12-month DSM-IV disorder, other than a substance use disorder, with a GAF score of less than 60. Results: All screening scales were significantly related to SMI. However, neither the CIDI-SF nor the WHO-DAS improved prediction significantly over the K10 or K6 scales. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of SMI was 0.854 for K10 and 0.865 for K6. The most efficient screening scale, K6, had a sensitivity (SE) of 0.36 (0.08) and a specificity of 0.96 (0.02) in predicting SMI. Conclusions: The brevity and accuracy of the K6 and K10 scales make them attractive screens for SMI. Routine inclusion of either scale in clinical studies would create an important, and heretofore missing, crosswalk between community and clinical epidemiology.},

Using general strain theory as an explanatory framework, we outline the means, motives, and opportunities for researchers to better their chances of publication independent of rigor and relevance. We then assess the frequency of QRPs in management research by tracking differences between dissertations and their resulting journal publications. Our primary finding is that from dissertation to journal article, the ratio of supported to unsupported hypotheses more than doubled (0.82 to 1.00 versus 1.94 to 1.00). The rise in predictive accuracy resulted from the dropping of statistically nonsignificant hypotheses, the addition of statistically significant hypotheses, the reversing of predicted direction of hypotheses, and alterations to data.

Recent methodology has advanced through the development of structural equation modeling, multi-level modeling, missing data methods, hierarchical linear modeling, categorical data analysis, as well as the development of many dedicated and specific behavioral models. These methodological approaches are based on a revised epistemological system, and have emerged naturally, without the need for task forces, or even much self-conscious discussion. The original goal was neither to develop nor promote a modeling revolution. That has occurred; I documented its development and its status. Two organizing principles are presented that show how both perspectives can be reconciled and accommodated. A program of research that could not have occurred within the standard NHST epistemology, without a modeling perspective, is discussed. An historical and cross-disciplinary analogy suggests their view is similar to Galileo's world view, whereas some branches of social and behavioral science may be ready for something closer to a Newtonian perspective.

@article{Schonbrodt2017,
abstract = {Unplanned optional stopping rules have been criticized for inflating Type I error rates under the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm. Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50{\%} to 70{\%} smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.},

@article{Ly,
abstract = {5 Harold Jeffreys pioneered the development of default Bayes factor hypothesis tests for standard statistical problems. Using Jeffreys's Bayes factor hypothesis tests, researchers can grade the decisiveness of the evidence that the data provide for a point null hypothesis H 0 versus a composite alternative hypothesis H 1. Consequently, Jeffreys's tests are of considerable theoretical and practical relevance for empirical researchers in general and for experimental psychologists in particular. To highlight this relevance and to facilitate the interpretation and use of Jeffreys's Bayes factor tests we focus on two common inferential scenarios: testing the nullity of a normal mean (i.e., the Bayesian equivalent of the t-test) and testing the nullity of a correlation. For both Bayes factor tests, we explain their development, we extend them to one-sided problems, and we apply them to concrete examples from experimental psychology. Consider the common scenario where a researcher entertains two competing hypotheses. 7 One, the null hypothesis H 0 , is implemented as a statistical model that stipulates the nullity of 8 a parameter of interest (i.e., µ = 0); the other, the alternative hypothesis H 1 , is implemented 9 as a statistical model that allows the parameter of interest to differ from zero. How should 10 one quantify the relative support that the observed data provide for H 0 versus H 1 ? Harold 11 Jeffreys argued that this is done by assigning prior mass to the point null hypothesis (or 12 "general law") H 0 , and then calculate the degree to which the data shift one's prior beliefs 13 about the relative plausibility of H 0 versus H 1 .},

@article{Wagenmakers2016,
abstract = {According to the facial feedback hypothesis, people's affective responses can be influenced by their own facial expression (e.g., smiling, pouting), even when their expression did not result from their emotional experiences. For example, Strack, Martin, and Stepper (1988) instructed participants to rate the funniness of cartoons using a pen that they held in their mouth. In line with the facial feedback hypothesis, when participants held the pen with their teeth (inducing a “smile”), they rated the cartoons as funnier than when they held the pen with their lips (inducing a “pout”). This seminal study of the facial feedback hypothesis has not been replicated directly. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 17 independent direct replications of Study 1 from Strack et al. (1988), all of which followed the same vetted protocol. A meta-analysis of these studies examined the difference in funniness ratings between the “smile” and “pout” conditions. The original Strack et al. (1988) study reported a rating difference of 0.82 units on a 10-point Likert scale. Our meta-analysis revealed a rating difference of 0.03 units with a 95{\%} confidence interval ranging from −0.11 to 0.16.},

abstract = {It is regarded as best practice for psychologists to report effect size when disseminating quantitative research findings. Reporting of effect size in the psychological literature is patchy - though this may be changing - and when reported it is far from clear that appropriate effect size statistics are employed. This paper considers the practice of reporting point estimates of standardized effect size and explores factors such as reliability, range restriction and differences in design that distort standardized effect size unless suitable corrections are employed. For most purposes simple (unstandardized) effect size is more robust and versatile than standardized effect size. Guidelines for deciding what effect size metric to use and how to report it are outlined. Foremost among these are: (i) a preference for simple effect size over standardized effect size, and (ii) the use of confidence intervals to indicate a plausible range of values the effect might take. Deciding on the appropriate effect size statistic to report always requires careful thought and should be influenced by the goals of the researcher, the context of the research and the potential needs of readers. {\textcopyright} 2009 The British Psychological Society.},

abstract = {Complex nonparametric models-like neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines-are more common than ever in predictive analytics, especially when dealing with large observational databases that don't adhere to the strict assumptions imposed by traditional statistical techniques (e.g., multiple linear regression which assumes linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality). Unfortunately, it can be challenging to understand the results of such models and explain them to management. Partial dependence plots offer a simple solution. Partial dependence plots are low-dimensional graphical renderings of the prediction function so that the relationship between the outcome and predictors of interest can be more easily understood. These plots are especially useful in explaining the output from black box models. In this paper, we introduce pdp, a general R package for constructing partial dependence plots.},

abstract = {Regression models allow one to isolate the relationship between the outcome and an explanatory variable while the other variables are held constant. Here, we introduce an R package, visreg, for the convenient visualization of this relationship via short, simple function calls. In addition to estimates of this relationship, the package also provides pointwise confidence bands and partial residuals to allow assessment of variability as well as outliers and other deviations from modeling assumptions. The package provides several options for visualizing models with interactions, including lattice plots, contour plots, and both static and interactive perspective plots. The implementation of the package is designed to be fully object-oriented and interface seamlessly with R's rich collection of model classes, allowing a consistent interface for visualizing not only linear models, but generalized linear models, proportional hazards models, generalized additive models, robust regression models, and many more.},

The second section shows that general cognitive ability predicts objective, rigorously content valid work sample performance with even higher validity. Path analysis shows that much of this predictive power stems from the fact that general cognitive ability predicts job knowledge (r = .80 for civilian jobs) and job knowledge predicts job performance (r = .80). However, cognitive ability predicts performance beyond this value (r = .75 versus r = [.80][.80] = .64) verifying job analyses showing that most major cognitive skills are used in everyday work.

abstract = {The goal of visualization is to effectively and accurately communicate data. Visualization research has often overlooked the errors and uncertainty which accompany the scientific process and describe key characteristics used to fully understand the data. The lack of these representations can be attributed, in part, to the inherent difficulty in defining, characterizing, and controlling this uncertainty, and in part, to the difficulty in including additional visual metaphors in a well designed, potent display. However, the exclusion of this information cripples the use of visualization as a decision making tool due to the fact that the display is no longer a true representation of the data. This systematic omission of uncertainty commands fundamental research within the visualization community to address, integrate, and expect uncertainty information. In this chapter, we outline sources and models of uncertainty, give an overview of the state-of-the-art, provide general guidelines, outline small exemplary applications, and finally, discuss open problems in uncertainty visualization.},

For each of the levels of cognitive processing, we discuss examples of biases from the cognitive science literature, and speculate how they might also be important to the area of visualization. In addition, we put forward a methodological discussion on how biases might be studied on all three levels, and which pitfalls and threats to validity exist. We hope that the framework will help spark new ideas and discussions on how to proceed studying the important topic of biases in visualization.},

The debates have originated from some unfortunate events of scientific misconduct in the field, and they have reached a climax with the recent discovery of a relatively weak rate of replicability of published literature, leading to the so-called replicability crisis in psychology. The present paper is concerned with examining the issue of replicability in the field of social psychology. We begin by drawing a state of the art of the crisis in this field. We then highlight some possible causes for the crisis, discussing topics of statistical power, questionable research practices, publication standards, and hidden auxiliary assumptions of context-dependency of social psychological theories. Finally, we argue that given the absence of absolute falsification in science, social psychology could greatly benefit from adopting McGuire's perspectivist approach to knowledge construction.},

Misinterpretations of the p value and the introduction of bias through arbitrary analytical choices have been discussed in the literature for decades. Nonetheless, they seem to have persisted in empirical research, and criticisms of p value misuses have increased in the recent past due to the non-replicability of many studies. Unfortunately, the critical concerns that have been raised in the literature are scattered over many disciplines, often linguistically confusing, and differing in their main reasons for criticisms. Misuses and misinterpretations of the p value are currently intensely discussed under the label “replication crisis” in many academic disciplines and journals, ranging from specialised scientific journals to Nature and Science. In a drastic response to the crisis, the editors of the journal Basic and Applied Social Psychology even decided to ban the use of p values from future publications at the beginning of 2015, a fact that has added fuel to the discussions in the relevant scientific forums. Finally, in March 2016, the American Statistical Association released a brief statement on p values that explicitly addressed misuses and misinterpretations. In this context, we systematise the most serious flaws related to the p value and discuss suggestions of how to prevent mistakes and reduce the rate of false discoveries in the future.},

Though 97{\%} of the original studies produced statistically significant results, only 36{\%} of the replication studies did so (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This inability to replicate previously published results, however, is not limited to psychology (Ioannidis, 2005). Replication projects in medicine (Prinz et al., 2011) and behavioral economics (Camerer et al., 2016) resulted in replication rates of 25 and 61{\%}, respectively, and analyses in genetics (Munaf{\`{o}}, 2009) and neuroscience (Button et al., 2013) question the validity of studies in those fields. Science, in general, is reckoning with challenges in one of its basic tenets: replication. Comparative psychology also faces the grand challenge of producing replicable research. Though social psychology has born the brunt of most of the critique regarding failed replications, comparative psychology suffers from some of the same problems faced by social psychology (e.g., small sample sizes). Yet, comparative psychology follows the methods of cognitive psychology by often using within-subjects designs, which may buffer it from replicability problems (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). In this Grand Challenge article, I explore the shared and unique challenges of and potential solutions for replication and reproducibility in comparative psychology.},

abstract = {Scientists are becoming increasingly aware of a “replicability crisis” in the behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences. Researchers have made progress identifying statistical and methodological causes of the crisis. However, the social structure of science is also to blame. In the fields affected by the crisis, nobody is explicitly responsible and rewarded for doing confirmation and replication work. This paper makes the case for a social structural reform to address the problem. I argue that we need to establish a reward system that supports a dedicated group of confirmation researchers and formulate a proposal that would achieve this.},

abstract = {Background: A key skill for a practising clinician is being able to do research, understand the statistical analyses and interpret results in the medical literature. Basic statistics has become essential within medical education, but when, what and in which format is uncertain. Methods: To inform curriculum design/development we undertook a quantitative survey of fifth year medical students and followed them up with a series of focus groups to obtain their opinions as to what statistics teaching they want, when and how. Results: A total of 145 students undertook the survey and five focus groups were held with between 3 and 9 partici-pants each. Previous statistical training varied and students recognised their knowledge was inadequate and keen to see additional training implemented. Students were aware of the importance of statistics to their future careers, but appre-hensive about learning. Face-to-face teaching supported by online resources was popular. Focus groups indicated the need for statistical training early in their degree and highlighted their lack of confidence and inconsistencies in support. Conclusion: The study found that the students see the importance of statistics training in the medical curriculum but that timing and mode of delivery are key. The findings have informed the design of a new course to be implemented in the third undergraduate year. Teaching will be based around published studies aiming to equip students with the basics required with additional resources available through a virtual learning environment.},

abstract = {{\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2015 Browman et al.Background: Continuous escalation in methodological and procedural rigor for evidence-based processes in guideline development is associated with increasing costs and production delays that threaten sustainability. While health research methodologists are appropriately responsible for promoting increasing rigor in guideline development, guideline sponsors are responsible for funding such processes. Discussion: This paper acknowledges that other stakeholders in addition to methodologists should be more involved in negotiating trade-offs between methodological procedures and efficiency in guideline production to produce guidelines that are 'good enough' to be trustworthy and affordable under specific circumstances. The argument for reasonable methodological compromise to meet practical circumstances is consistent with current implicit methodological practice. This paper proposes a conceptual tool as a framework to be used by different stakeholders in negotiating, and explicitly reporting, reasonable compromises for trustworthy as well as cost-worthy guidelines. The framework helps fill a transparency gap in how methodological choices in guideline development are made. The principle, 'when good is good enough' can serve as a basis for this approach. Summary: The conceptual tool 'Efficiency-Validity Methodological Continuum' acknowledges trade-offs between validity and efficiency in evidence-based guideline development and allows for negotiation, guided by methodologists, of reasonable methodological compromises among stakeholders. Collaboration among guideline stakeholders in the development process is necessary if evidence-based guideline development is to be sustainable.},

abstract = {Across the social sciences, growing concerns about research transparency have led to calls for pre-analysis plans (PAPs) that specify in advance how researchers intend to analyze the data they are about to gather. PAPs promote transparency and credibility by helping readers distinguish between exploratory and confirmatory analyses. However, PAPs are time-consuming to write and may fail to anticipate contingencies that arise in the course of data collection. This article proposes the use of “standard operating procedures” (SOPs)—default practices to guide decisions when issues arise that were not anticipated in the PAP. We offer an example of an SOP that can be adapted by other researchers seeking a safety net to support their PAPs.},

abstract = {Statistical graphs-in particular, line graphs and bar graphs-are efficient means of communication in a wide range of non-expert settings. In communication settings, statistical graphs do not only serve as visualizations of individual data points but also provide visual access to various aspects of the information contained in data. Moreover, specific types of graphs are better means for providing visual access to certain aspects of data. For instance, trend information is visually conveyed through line graphs and bar graphs in the time domain. The interpretation of the information content in a graph is influenced by several factors, such as perceptual salience of line segments in a line graph. In addition, the presence of graphical cues substantially influences the interpretation of graph readers. Graphical cues are visual elements, usually in the form of point markers, non-directional lines, curves and arrows. They play a communicative role in communication through graphs. The present study reports an experimental investigation, in which the participants provided verbal descriptions of a set of graphs with/without graphical cues. The stimuli involved line graphs and bar graphs that represented the same data. The analyses of eye movements and verbal protocols reveal that the interpretations of the participants are systematically influenced by the presence or absence of a graphical cue, the type of the graphical cue (i.e., a point marker vs. an arrow), as well as the type of the graph (i.e., a line graph vs. a bar graph). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with a poorly understood preclinical stage of immune dysregulation and symptom accrual. Accumulation of antinuclear autoantibody (ANA) specificities is a hallmark of impending clinical disease. Yet, many ANA-positive individuals remain healthy, suggesting that additional immune dysregulation underlies SLE pathogenesis. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that interferon (IFN) pathways are dysregulated in preclinical SLE. To determine if other forms of immune dysregulation contribute to preclinical SLE pathogenesis, we measured SLE-associated autoantibodies and soluble mediators in samples from 84 individuals collected prior to SLE classification (average timespan = 5.98 years), compared to unaffected, healthy control samples matched by race, gender, age (±5 years), and time of sample procurement. We found that multiple soluble mediators, including interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, and IFN-$\gamma$, were significantly elevated in cases compared to controls more than 3.5 years pre-classification, prior to or concurrent with autoantibody positivity. Additional mediators, including innate cytokines, IFN-associated chemokines, and soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily mediators increased longitudinally in cases approaching SLE classification, but not in controls. In particular, levels of B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) were comparable in cases and controls until less than 10 months pre-classification. Over the entire pre-classification period, random forest models incorporating ANA and anti-Ro/SSA positivity with levels of IL-5, IL-6, and the IFN-$\gamma$-induced chemokine, MIG, distinguished future SLE patients with 92{\%} (±1.8{\%}) accuracy, compared to 78{\%} accuracy utilizing ANA positivity alone. These data suggest that immune dysregulation involving multiple pathways contributes to SLE pathogenesis. Importantly, distinct immunological profiles are predictive for individuals who will develop clinical SLE and may be useful for delineating early pathogenesis, discovering therapeutic targets, and designing prevention trials.},

This study evaluates the individual and combined contributions of autoantibodies, type I interferon (IFN-$\alpha$) activity, and IFN-associated soluble mediators to disease development leading to SLE.Methods Serial serum specimens from 55 individuals collected prior to SLE classification (average timespan=4.3 years) and unaffected healthy controls matched by age (±5 years), gender, race and time of sample procurement were obtained from the Department of Defense Serum Repository. Levels of serum IFN-$\alpha$ activity, IFN-associated mediators and autoantibodies were evaluated and temporal relationships assessed by growth curve modelling, path analysis, analysis of covariance and random forest models.Results In cases, but not matched controls, autoantibody specificities and IFN-associated mediators accumulated over a period of years, plateauing near the time of disease classification (p{\&}lt;0.001). Autoantibody positivity coincided with or followed type II IFN dysregulation, preceding IFN-$\alpha$ activity in growth curve models, with elevated IFN-$\alpha$ activity and B-lymphocyte stimulator levels occurring shortly before SLE classification (p≤0.005).

They serve as quick and efficient tools for checking data distributions, variable relations, and the potential appropriateness of different statistical analyses (e.g., do data meet the minimum assumptions for a particular analytic method). Consequently, we believe that GDs can promote increased transparency in the journal review process, encourage best practices for data analysis, and promote a more inductive approach to understanding psychological data. We illustrate the value of potentially including GDs as a step in the peer-review process and provide a user-friendly online resource (www.graphicaldescriptives.org) for researchers interested in including data visualizations in their research.

abstract = {Introduction: Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate data analytic technique used in many domains of addictive behaviors research. SEM results are usually summarized and communicated through statistical tables and path diagrams, which emphasize path coefficients and global fit without showing specific quantitative values of data points that underlie the model results. Data visualization methods are often absent in SEM research, which may limit the quality and impact of SEM research by reducing data transparency, obscuring unexpected data anomalies and unmodeled heterogeneity, and inhibiting the communication of SEM research findings to research stakeholders who do not have advanced statistical training in SEM. Methods and results: In this report, we show how data visualization methods can address these limitations and improve the quality of SEM-based addictive behaviors research. We first introduce SEM and data visualization methodologies and differentiate data visualizations from model visualizations that are commonly used in SEM, such as path diagrams. We then discuss ways researchers may utilize data visualization in SEM research, including by obtaining estimates of latent variables and by visualizing multivariate relations in two-dimensional figures. R syntax is provided to help others generate data visualizations for several types of effects commonly modeled in SEM, including correlation, regression, moderation, and simple mediation. Discussion: The techniques outlined here may help spur the use of data visualization in SEM-based addictive behaviors research. Using data visualization in SEM may enhance methodological transparency and improve communication of research findings.},

abstract = {Computers provide ubiquitous contact to data graphs. Yet, employing the power of the human perception system bears the risk of being subject to its biases. Data graphs are used to present the means of different conditions and are supposed to convey group information, such as variability across conditions, as well as the grand average. Across three samples, we tested whether there is a bias in the central tendency perceived in bar graphs, 53 participants with a mean age of 27 years (plus replication with N = 38, mean age = 23 years). Participants were provided with bar and point graphs and had to judge their means. We found that the mean value was systematically underestimated in bar graphs (but not in point graphs) across different methods of testing for biased evaluation. In a second experiment (N = 80, mean age = 24 years) we replicated and extended this finding, by testing the effect of outliers on the bias in average estimation. For instance, outliers might trigger controlled processing. Yet, the underestimation of the average was replicated and was not affected by including outliers—despite that the estimate was torn towards the outlier. Thus, we should be cautious with relying on bar graphs when a bias free estimate of the grand average is relevant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Humans find reasoning about uncertainty difficult. In decision support systems and software for intelligence analysis, graphical representations are commonly used to display uncertainty. Nevertheless, our understanding of how people use the information presented in graphs displaying uncertainty to make decisions is limited. As many artificial intelligent systems require a human-in-the-loop who is able to actively take part in the analysis process, the understanding of high-level cognition involved in human-graph interaction is essential in the design of better tools for analysis. In this research, we investigate the visual behaviour that is associated with participants responses to problems testing probabilistic reasoning represented through two different visualizations (tree and Venn diagrams). Using the data from visual fixations and transitions, we present a description of different reasoning strategies covering both accurate and inaccurate reasoning for different visualization formats. The results show that gaze behaviour is related to reasoning accuracy. Moreover, this study shows that different graphs representing the same problem evoke different reasoning strategies, suggesting that higher level cognition is influenced by the graphical representation in which uncertainty is encoded.

abstract = {Across science, education, and business, we process and communicate data visually. One bedrock finding in data visualization research is a hierarchy of precision for perceptual encodings of data (e.g., that encoding data with Cartesian positions allows more precise comparisons than encoding with sizes). But this hierarchy has only been tested for single-value comparisons, under the assumption that those lessons would extrapolate to multivalue comparisons. We show that when comparing averages across multiple data points, even for pairs of data points, these differences vanish. Viewers instead compare values using surprisingly primitive perceptual cues (e.g., the summed area of bars in a bar graph). These results highlight a critical need to study a broader constellation of visual cues that mediate the patterns that we can see in data, across visualization types and tasks.

abstract = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-known classification technique that enjoyed great success in practical applications. Despite its effectiveness for traditional low-dimensional problems, extensions of LDA are necessary in order to classify high-dimensional data. Many variants of LDA have been proposed in the literature. However, most of these methods do not fully incorporate the structure information among predictors when such information is available. In this paper, we introduce a new high-dimensional LDA technique, namely graph-based sparse LDA (GSLDA), that utilizes the graph structure among the features. In particular, we use the regularized regression formulation for penalized LDA techniques, and propose to impose a structure-based sparse penalty on the discriminant vector $\beta$ . The graph structure can be either given or estimated from the training data. Moreover, we explore the relationship between the within-class feature structure and the overall feature structure. Based on this relationship, we further propose a variant of our proposed GSLDA to utilize effectively unlabeled data, which can be abundant in the semi-supervised learning setting. With the new regularization, we can obtain a sparse estimate of $\beta$ and more accurate and interpretable classifiers than many existing methods. Both the selection consistency of $\beta$ estimation and the convergence rate of the classifier are established, and the resulting classifier has an asymptotic Bayes error rate. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed GSLDA on both simulated and real data studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Discrepancies between pre-specified and reported outcomes are an important and prevalent source of bias in clinical trials. COMPare (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Outcome Monitoring Project) monitored all trials in five leading journals for correct outcome reporting, submitted correction letters on all misreported trials in real time, and then monitored responses from editors and trialists. From the trialists' responses, we aimed to answer two related questions. First, what can trialists' responses to corrections on their own misreported trials tell us about trialists' knowledge of correct outcome reporting? Second, what can a cohort of responses to a standardised correction letter tell us about how researchers respond to systematic critical post-publication peer review? All correspondence from trialists, published by journals in response to a correction letter from COMPare, was filed and indexed. We analysed the letters qualitatively and identified key themes in researchers' errors about correct outcome reporting, and approaches taken by researchers when their work was criticised. Trialists frequently expressed views that contradicted the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines or made inaccurate statements about correct outcome reporting. Common themes were: stating that pre-specification after trial commencement is acceptable; incorrect statements about registries; incorrect statements around the handling of multiple time points; and failure to recognise the need to report changes to pre-specified outcomes in the trial report. We identified additional themes in the approaches taken by researchers when responding to critical correspondence, including the following: ad hominem criticism; arguing that trialists should be trusted, rather than follow guidelines for trial reporting; appealing to the existence of a novel category of outcomes whose results need not necessarily be reported; incorrect statements by researchers about their own paper; and statements undermining transparency infrastructure, such as trial registers. Researchers commonly make incorrect statements about correct trial reporting. There are recurring themes in researchers' responses when their work is criticised, some of which fall short of the scientific ideal. Research on methodological shortcomings is now common, typically in the form of retrospective cohort studies describing the overall prevalence of a problem. We argue that prospective cohort studies which additionally issue correction letters in real time on each individual flawed study—and then follow-up responses from trialists and journals—are more impactful, more informative for those consuming the studies critiqued, more informative on the causes of shortcomings in research, and a better use of research resources.},

Van Assen, Van Aert, and Wicherts (2015) and Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons (2014a) developed p-uniform and p- curve, respectively. The methodology on which these methods are based has great promise for providing accurate meta-analytic estimates in the presence of publication bias. However, we show that in some situations p-curve behaves erratically while p-uniform may yield implausible negative effect size estimates. Moreover, we show that (and explain why) p-curve and p-uniform overestimate effect size under moderate to large heterogeneity, and may yield unpredictable bias when researchers employ p-hacking. We offer hands-on recommendations on applying and interpreting results of meta-analysis in general and p-uniform and p-curve in particular. Both methods as well as traditional methods are applied to a meta-analysis on the effect of weight on judgments of importance. We offer guidance for applying p-uniform or p-curve using R and a user-friendly web application for applying p-uniform (https://rvanaert.shinyapps.io/p-uniform).},

abstract = {Bayes factors provide a symmetrical measure of evidence for one model versus another (e.g. H1 versus H0) in order to relate theory to data. These properties help solve some (but not all) of the problems underlying the credibility crisis in psychology. The symmetry of the measure of evidence means that there can be evidence for H0 just as much as for H1; or the Bayes factor may indicate insufficient evidence either way. P-values cannot make this three-way distinction. Thus, Bayes factors indicate when the data count against a theory (and when they count for nothing); and thus they indicate when replications actually support H0 or H1 (in ways that power cannot). There is every reason to publish evidence supporting the null as going against it, because the evidence can be measured to be just as strong either way (thus the published record can be more balanced). Bayes factors can be B-hacked but they mitigate the problem because a) they allow evidence in either direction so people will be less tempted to hack in just one direction; b) as a measure of evidence they are insensitive to the stopping rule; c) families of tests cannot be arbitrarily defined; and d) falsely implying a contrast is planned rather than post hoc becomes irrelevant (though the value of pre-registration is not mitigated).},

Meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) refers to a set of meta-analysis techniques for combining and comparing structural equation modeling (SEM) results from multiple studies. Existing approaches to MASEM cannot appropriately model between-studies heterogeneity in structural parameters because of missing correlations, lack model fit assessment, and suffer from several theoretical limitations. In this study, we address the major shortcomings of existing approaches by proposing a novel Bayesian multilevel SEM approach. Simulation results showed that the proposed approach performed satisfactorily in terms of parameter estimation and model fit evaluation when the number of studies and the within-study sample size were sufficiently large and when correlations were missing completely at random. An empirical example about the structure of personality based on a subset of data was provided. Results favored the third factor structure over the hierarchical structure.

abstract = {Recursive partitioning methods have become popular and widely used tools for nonparametric regression and classification in many scientific fields. Especially random forests, which can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine, and bioinformatics within the past few years. High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application. Application of the methods is illustrated with freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Statistics is relevant to students and practitioners in medicine and health sciences and is increasingly taught as part of the medical curriculum. However, it is common for students to dislike and under-perform in statistics. We sought to address these issues by redesigning the way that statistics is taught. The project brought together a statistician, clinician and educational experts to re-conceptualize the syllabus, and focused on developing different methods of delivery. New teaching materials, including videos, animations and contextualized workbooks were designed and produced, placing greater emphasis on applying statistics and interpreting data. Two cohorts of students were evaluated, one with old style and one with new style teaching. Both were similar with respect to age, gender and previous level of statistics. Students who were taught using the new approach could better define the key concepts of p-value and confidence interval (p {\textless} 0.001 for both). They were more likely to regard statistics as integral to medical practice (p = 0.03), and to expect to use it in their medical career (p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in the numbers who thought that statistics was essential to understand the literature (p = 0.28) and those who felt comfortable with the basics of statistics (p = 0.06). More than half the students in both cohorts felt that they were comfortable with the basics of medical statistics. Using a variety of media, and placing emphasis on interpretation can help make teaching, learning and understanding of statistics more people-centred and relevant, resulting in better outcomes for students.},

SUMMARY The technique of iterative weighted linear regression can be used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters with observations distributed according to some exponential family and systematic effects that can be made linear by a suitable transformation. A generalization of the analysis of variance is given for these models using log-likelihoods. These generalized linear models are illustrated by examples relating to four distributions; the Normal, Binomial (probit analysis, etc.), Poisson (contingency tables) and gamma (variance components). The implications of the approach in designing statistics courses are discussed.},

This situation has generated problematic impasses, one of which is the emergence of an anti-vaccination movement that is already affecting public health, with a resurgence in the United States of preventable diseases thought to have been eradicated. Drawing on British sociologist Harry Collins' work on expertise, we propose a theoretical framework in which the paralyzing, undue public distrust of science can be analyzed and, it is hoped, overcome.},

Although the reliability of data is a serious concern, we argue that there is a deeper and more insidious problem in the field: the persistent and dramatic misinterpretation of empirical results that replicate easily and consistently. Using a series of four highly studied 'textbook' examples from different research domains (eyewitness memory, deductive reasoning, social psychology, and child welfare), we show how simple unrecognized incompatibilities among dependent measures, analysis tools, and the properties of data can lead to fundamental interpretive errors. These errors, which are not reduced by additional data collection, may lead to misguided research efforts and policy recommendations. We conclude with a set of recommended strategies and research tools to reduce the probability of these persistent and largely unrecognized errors. The use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves is highlighted as one such recommendation.},

@article{Schimmack2012,
abstract = {Cohen (1962) pointed out the importance of statistical power for psychology as a science, but statistical power of studies has not increased, while the number of studies in a single article has increased. It has been overlooked that multiple studies with modest power have a high probability of producing nonsignificant results because power decreases as a function of the number of statistical tests that are being conducted (Maxwell, 2004). The discrepancy between the expected number of significant results and the actual number of significant results in multiple-study articles undermines the credibility of the reported results, and it is likely that questionable research practices have contributed to the reporting of too many significant results (Sterling, 1959). The problem of low power in multiple-study articles is illustrated using Bem's (2011) article on extrasensory perception and Gailliot et al.'s (2007) article on glucose and self-regulation. I conclude with several recommendations that can increase the credibility of scientific evidence in psychological journals. One major recommendation is to pay more attention to the power of studies to produce positive results without the help of questionable research practices and to request that authors justify sample sizes with a priori predictions of effect sizes. It is also important to publish replication studies with nonsignificant results if these studies have high power to replicate a published finding.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to review research published by Educational Administration Quarterly (EAQ) during the past 10 years to determine if confidence intervals and effect sizes were being reported as recommended by the American Psychological Association (APA) Publication Manual. Research Design: The author examined 49 volumes of the journal, which included 245 articles from the most recent 10-year time frame. As the debate on statistical reform is focused on reporting confidence intervals and properly interpreting p values and null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST), the author examined all empirical studies from the 10-year time frame to determine if confidence intervals were included in the results and, if so, interpreted correctly. Because effect size measures are, alongside confidence intervals, at the heart of statistical reform goals in psychology, the author also examined effect-size practices in EAQ. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) were utilized to report the findings of the analysis. Findings: The results of the descriptive analysis indicated that effect sizes were being reported in the majority of quantitative studies with limited interpretation. In contrast, no quantitative study examined from the 10-year time frame reported confidence intervals, despite the recommendations of the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference and guidelines outlined in the most recent edition of the APA Publication Manual. Recommendations for statistical reform in reporting quantitative results in EAQ are presented, and future direction is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Hypothesizing after the results are known, or HARKing, occurs when researchers check their research results and then add or remove hypotheses on the basis of those results without acknowledging this process in their research report (Kerr, 1998). In the present article, I discuss 3 forms of HARKing: (a) using current results to construct post hoc hypotheses that are then reported as if they were a priori hypotheses; (b) retrieving hypotheses from a post hoc literature search and reporting them as a priori hypotheses; and (c) failing to report a priori hypotheses that are unsupported by the current results. These 3 types of HARKing are often characterized as being bad for science and a potential cause of the current replication crisis. In the present article, I use insights from the philosophy of science to present a more nuanced view. Specifically, I identify the conditions under which each of these 3 types of HARKing is most and least likely to be bad for science. I conclude with a brief discussion about the ethics of each type of HARKing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {In order to study the prevalence, nature (direction), and causes of reporting errors in psychology, we checked the consistency of reported test statistics, degrees of freedom, and p values in a random sample of high- and low-impact psychology journals. In a second study, we established the generality of reporting errors in a random sample of recent psychological articles. Our results, on the basis of 281 articles, indicate that around 18{\%} of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15{\%} of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers' expectations. We classified the most common errors and contacted authors to shed light on the origins of the errors.

By using a simple five-step procedure as a template for statistical inference problems, the student can solve problems in an organized fashion. The problem and its solution will thus be a stand-by-itself organic whole and a single unit of thought and effort. The described procedure can be used for both parametric and nonparametric inferential tests. The example given is a chi-square goodness-of-fit test of a genetics experiment involving a dihybrid cross in corn that follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. This experimental analysis is commonly done in introductory biology labs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Background: Recent reviews have drawn attention to frequent consistency errors when reporting statistical results. Method: We have reviewed the statistical results reported in 186 articles published in four Spanish psychology journals. Of these articles, 102 contained at least one of the statistics selected for our study: Fisher-F, Student-t and Pearson-X2. Results: Out of the 1,212 complete statistics reviewed, 12.2{\%} presented a consistency error, meaning that the reported p-value did not correspond to the reported value of the statistic and its degrees of freedom. In 2.3{\%} of the cases, the correct calculation would have led to a different conclusion than the reported one. In terms of articles, 48{\%} included at least one consistency error, and 17.6{\%} would have to change at least one conclusion. In meta-analytical terms, with a focus on effect size, consistency errors can be considered substantial in 9.5{\%} of the cases. Conclusion: These results imply a need to improve the quality and precision with which statistical results are reported in Spanish psychology journals.

@article{Fidler2004,
abstract = {Since the mid-1980s, confidence intervals (CIs) have been standard in medical journals. We sought lessons for psychology from medicine's experience with statistical reform by investigating two attempts by Kenneth Rothman to change statistical practices. We examined 594 American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) articles published between 1982 and 2000 and 110 Epidemiology articles published in 1990 and 2000. Rothman's editorial instruction to report CIs and not p values was largely effective: In AJPH, sole reliance on p values dropped from 63{\%} to 5{\%}, and Cl reporting rose from 10{\%} to 54{\%}; Epidemiology showed even stronger compliance. However, compliance was superficial: Very few authors referred to CIs when discussing results. The results of our survey support what other research has indicated: Editorial policy alone is not a sufficient mechanism for statistical reform. Achieving substantial, desirable change will require further guidance regarding use and interpretation of CIs and appropriate effect size measures. Necessary steps will include studying researchers' understanding of CIs, improving education, and developing empirically justified recommendations for improved statistical practice.

The realization that many individual findings do not replicate in new studies has led to questioning the scientific method and the integrity of psychological science. We review the history of the replication crisis, and its positive and negative effects. Most of the elements of the replication crisis are re-emergent issues that methodologists have studied in the past, but to which researchers have become increasingly sensitized. Ultimately, we argue the value of the replication crisis, in that it has led to positive self-examination within our science and to the development of new and innovative methodology. The field is emerging from the replication crisis with a realization of the importance of multiple replication efforts, and an improved ethic of openness and transparency in the conduct of research.

We reevaluate that structure using latent pattern models from statistical machine learning, also known as mixed-membership models, that identify semantic structure in co-occurrence of words in the abstracts and references. Our findings suggest that the latent dimensionality of patterns underlying PNAS research articles in the Biological Sciences is only slightly larger than the number of categories currently in use, but it differs substantially in the content of the categories. Further, the number of articles that are listed under multiple categories is only a small fraction of what it should be.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. P values represent a widely used, but pervasively misunderstood and fiercely contested method of scientific inference. Display items, such as figures and tables, often containing the main results, are an important source of P values. We conducted a survey comparing the overall use of P values and the occurrence of significant P values in display items of a sample of articles in the three top multidisciplinary journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) in 2017 and, respectively, in 1997. We also examined the reporting of multiplicity corrections and its potential influence on the proportion of statistically significant P values. Our findings demonstrated substantial and growing reliance on P values in display items, with increases of 2.5 to 14.5 times in 2017 compared to 1997. The overwhelming majority of P values (94{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]  92{\%} to 96{\%}) were statistically significant. Methods to adjust for multiplicity were almost non-existent in 1997, but reported in many articles relying on P values in 2017 (Nature 68{\%}, Science 48{\%}, PNAS 38{\%}). In their absence, almost all reported P values were statistically significant (98{\%}, 95{\%} CI 96{\%} to 99{\%}). Conversely, when any multiplicity corrections were described, 88{\%} (95{\%} CI 82{\%} to 93{\%}) of reported P values were statistically significant. Use of Bayesian methods was scant (2.5{\%}) and rarely (0.7{\%}) articles relied exclusively on Bayesian statistics. Overall, wider appreciation of the need for multiplicity corrections is a welcome evolution, but the rapid growth of reliance on P values and implausibly high rates of reported statistical significance are worrisome.},

abstract = {Formal empirical assessments of replication have recently become more prominent in several areas of science, including psychology. These assessments have used different statistical approaches to determine if a finding has been replicated. The purpose of this article is to provide several alternative conceptual frameworks that lead to different statistical analyses to test hypotheses about replication. All of these analyses are based on statistical methods used in meta-analysis. The differences among the methods described involve whether the burden of proof is placed on replication or nonreplication, whether replication is exact or allows for a small amount of “negligible heterogeneity,” and whether the studies observed are assumed to be fixed (constituting the entire body of relevant evidence) or are a sample from a universe of possibly relevant studies. The statistical power of each of these tests is computed and shown to be low in many cases, raising issues of the interpretability of tests for replication.

Even in situations where the hypothesis testing paradigm is correct, the common practice of basing inferences solely on p-values has been under intense criticism for over 50 years. We propose, as an alternative, the use of the odds of a correct rejection of the null hypothesis to incorrect rejection. Both pre-experimental versions (involving the power and Type I error) and post-experimental versions (depending on the actual data) are considered. Implementations are provided that range from depending only on the p-value to consideration of full Bayesian analysis. A surprise is that all implementations-even the full Bayesian analysis-have complete frequentist justification. Versions of our proposal can be implemented that require only minor modifications to existing practices yet overcome some of their most severe shortcomings.},

In part, this may be because many researchers rely on intuition, rules of thumb, and prior practice (along with practical considerations) to determine the number of subjects to test. In Study 1, we surveyed 291 published research psychologists and found large discrepancies between their reports of their preferred amount of power and the actual power of their studies (calculated from their reported typical cell size, typical effect size, and acceptable alpha). Furthermore, in Study 2, 89{\%} of the 214 respondents overestimated the power of specific research designs with a small expected effect size, and 95{\%} underestimated the sample size needed to obtain .80 power for detecting a small effect. Neither researchers' experience nor their knowledge predicted the bias in their self-reported power intuitions. Because many respondents reported that they based their sample sizes on rules of thumb or common practice in the field, we recommend that researchers conduct and report formal power analyses for their studies.},

abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favor them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing---no deliberate cheating nor loafing---by scientists, only that publication is a principle factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modeling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioral sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more "progeny", such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

Also provided are formulas and recommendations regarding how the sampling variance of effect size statistics should be estimated in each of these cases. The conversion formula for extreme groups designs, originally due to Feldt (1961), can be viewed as a generalization of Hunter and Schmidt's (1990) method for dichotomization designs. A simulation study examines the finite-sample properties of the proposed methods. The conclusion highlights areas where current guidance in the literature should be amended or clarified.},

abstract = {The most widely used statistical model for conducting moderation analysis is the moderated multiple regression (MMR) model. In MMR modeling, missing data could pose a challenge, mainly because the interaction term is a product of two or more variables and thus is a nonlinear function of the involved variables. In this study, we consider a simple MMR model, where the effect of the focal predictor X on the outcome Y is moderated by a moderator U. The primary interest is to find ways of estimating and testing the moderation effect with the existence of missing data in X. We mainly focus on cases when X is missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR). Three methods are compared: (a) Normal-distribution-based maximum likelihood estimation (NML); (b) Normal-distribution-based multiple imputation (NMI); and (c) Bayesian estimation (BE). Via simulations, we found that NML and NMI could lead to biased estimates of moderation effects under MAR missingness mechanism. The BE method outperformed NMI and NML for MMR modeling with missing data in the focal predictor, missingness depending on the moderator and/or auxiliary variables, and correctly specified distributions for the focal predictor. In addition, more robust BE methods are needed in terms of the distribution mis-specification problem of the focal predictor. An empirical example was used to illustrate the applications of the methods with a simple sensitivity analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record},

The authors address this gap in the literature by suggesting a general statistical model for range restriction corrections. Because the multiple-hurdle design includes as special cases predictive and concurrent designs, the corrections apply also to these designs. The general correction model is based on algorithms from the missing data literature. Two missing data procedures are examined: the estimation-maximization procedure and the Bayesian multiple imputation (MI) procedure. These procedures are large-sample equivalent and often yield similar results. The MI procedure, however, has the added advantage of providing easily obtainable standard errors.

We then evaluate the accuracy of the Case V method vis-` a-vis existing methods. Monte-Carlo simulation results indicate that the Case V method provides very accurate estimates for the mean true score correlation and reasonably accurate estimates for the true standard deviation. More important, Case V almost always provides more accurate results than alternative methods (particularly, Case IV). To illustrate how the Case V method works with real data, we conduct a reanalysis of Judge, Heller, and Mount's (2002) meta-analysis examining the relationships between the Big 5 personality traits and job satisfaction. Results indicate that the true score correlations between the Big 5 traits and job satisfaction have been underestimated, whereas their true standard deviations have been overestimated.

The reported median effect size was d=0.93 (inter-quartile range: 0.64-1.46) for nominally statistically significant results and d=0.24 (0.11-0.42) for non-significant results. Median power to detect small, medium and large effects was 0.12, 0.44 and 0.73, reflecting no improvement through the past half-century. Power was lowest for cognitive neuroscience journals. 14{\%} of papers reported some statistically significant results, although the respective F statistic and degrees of freedom proved that these were non-significant; p value errors positively correlated with journal impact factors. False report probability is likely to exceed 50{\%} for the whole literature. In light of our findings the recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic and worse performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience.},

The present paper delineates the factors that influence the joint impact of attenuation and range restriction on the magnitude of the correlation coefficient, and establishes a theoretical framework for the generation of appropriate correction formulas. A set of equations for making joint attenuation and range restriction corrections when there is attenuation and restriction on the predictor is presented. Finally, it is shown that the concept of predictor reliability changes in selection situations because of the correlation between error and true scores.},

However, less is known about the psychological mechanisms underlying this association. Here, we tested the role of mindfulness in mediating this association in Chinese adolescents who attended high schools. In Study 1 (N = 1262), we first verified the association between the grit and subjective well-being, given that this association has not been reported in the Chinese population. Consistent with the previous literature, higher levels of grit were associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, more positive affect, and less negative affect. In Study 2 (N = 627), we replicated the association between grit and subjective well-being. More importantly, mediation analyses demonstrated that the association was partly mediated by mindfulness. Together, our findings suggest that the grit may help boost adolescents' subjective well-being through their mindful mind in pursuing their long-term goals.},

abstract = {Pearson product moment correlations are often corrected for statistical artifacts such as range restriction and unreliability. Formulas have long existed to make such corrections. However, other effect size estimates are rarely corrected for these artifacts, in spite of the fact that there is an established mathematical link between the correlation and some effect size estimates. Correlations and other effect sizes are therefore vulnerable to the same artifacts. The authors take a common effect size estimate, the standardized mean difference between two groups, and derive (and reaffirm in one instance) correction formulas suitable for use with this statistic. It is demonstrated how these formulas might substantially increase the precision of estimates and decisions made within organizational research and practice, whenever correction factors can be appropriately estimated. An Example In addition to the investigation of validity and other test attributes (e.g., cost), suppose a human resource manager is interested in finding a selection test that has less adverse impact than a traditional measure of cognitive ability. The manager knows/ assumes that if a selection test of cognitive ability is used, then Whites will score, on average, about 1.0 standard deviations higher than Blacks on the test (Sackett {\&} Wilk, 1994). The manager sponsors research on recent hires (incumbents selected on the basis of a cognitive ability test) and finds that the use of a biodata measure leads to a smaller difference , say, .3 of a standard deviation, between Whites and Blacks. The manager concludes that the biodata measure has substantially less adverse impact potential for entry-level selection than the cognitive ability test. Is this conclusion accurate?},

abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes-a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

abstract = {It is well known that even experienced scientists routinely misinterpret p-values in all sorts of ways, including confusion of statistical and practical significance, treating non-rejection as acceptance of the null hypothesis, and interpreting the p-value as some sort of replication probability or as the posterior probability that the null hypothesis is true. A common conceptual error is that researchers take the rejection of a straw-man null as evidence in favor of their preferred alternative (Gelman, 2014). A standard mode of operation goes like this: p {\textless} 0.05 is taken as strong evidence against the null hypothesis, p {\textgreater} 0.15 is taken as evidence in favor of the null, and p near 0.10 is taken either as weak evidence for an effect or as evidence of a weak effect. Unfortunately, none of those inferences is generally appropriate: a low p-value is not necessarily strong evidence against the null (see, for example, Morris, 1987, and Gelman and Carlin 2014), a high p-value does not necessarily favor the null (the strength and even the direction of the evidence depends on the alternative hypotheses), and p-values are in general not measures of the size of any underlying effect. But these errors persist, reflecting (a) inherent difficulties in the mathematics and logic of p-values, and (b) the desire of researchers to draw strong conclusions from their data. Continued evidence of these and other misconceptions and their dire consequences for science (the " replication crisis " in psychology, biology, and other applied fields), especially in light of new understanding of how common it is that abundant " researcher degrees of freedom " (Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn, 2011) and " gardens of forking paths " (Gelman and Loken, 2014) allow researchers to routinely obtain statistically significant and publishable results from noise, motivated the American Statistical Association to release a Statement on Statistical Significance and p-values in an attempt to highlight the magnitude and importance of problems with current standard practice (Wasserstein and Lazar, 2016). At this point it would be natural for statisticians to think that this is a problem of education and communication. If we could just add a few more paragraphs to the relevant sections of our textbooks, and persuade applied practitioners to consult more with statisticians, then all would be well, or so goes this logic. In their new paper, McShane and Gal present survey data showing that even authors of published articles in a top statistics journal are often confused about the meaning of p-values, especially by treating 0.05, or the range 0.05–0.15, as the location of a threshold. The underlying problem seems to be deterministic thinking. To put it another way, applied researchers and also statisticians are in the habit of demanding more certainty than their data can legitimately supply. The problem is not just that 0.05 is an arbitrary convention; rather, even a seemingly wide range of p-values such as 0.01–0.10 cannot serve to classify evidence in the desired way (Gelman and Stern, 2006).},

The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Real-time ecological momentary interventions have shown promising effects in domains other than alcohol use; however, only few studies regarding ecological momentary interventions for alcohol use have been conducted thus far. The increasing popularity of smartphones offers new avenues for intervention and innovation in data collection. OBJECTIVE We aimed to test the efficacy of an ecological momentary intervention, comprising mobile Web-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and text messaging (short message service, SMS) brief interventions, delivered during drinking events using participants' mobile phones. METHODS We conducted a three-armed randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of a mobile Web-based ecological momentary assessment with texting feedback on self-reported alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms in young adults. Participants were enrolled from an existing observational cohort study of young adults screened for risky drinking behavior. The intervention group (ecological momentary intervention group) completed repeated ecological momentary assessments during 6 drinking events and received immediate texting-based feedback in response to each ecological momentary assessment. The second group (ecological momentary assessment group) completed ecological momentary assessments without the brief intervention, and the third did not receive any contact during the trial period. Recent peak risky single-occasion drinking was assessed at the baseline and follow-up using telephone interviews. We used a random effects mixed modeling approach using maximum likelihood estimation to provide estimates of differences in mean drinking levels between groups between baseline and 12-week follow-up. RESULTS A total of 269 participants were randomized into the 3 groups. The ecological momentary intervention group exhibited a small and nonsignificant increase between baseline and follow-up in (geometric) the mean number of standard drinks consumed at the most recent heavy drinking occasion (mean 12.5 vs 12.7). Both ecological momentary assessment and control groups exhibited a nonsignificant decrease (ecological momentary assessment: mean 13.8 vs 11.8; control: mean 12.3 vs 11.6); these changes did not differ significantly between groups (Wald $\chi$22 1.6; P=.437) and the magnitude of the effects of the intervention were markedly small. No other significant differences between groups on measures of alcohol consumption or related harms were observed. The intervention acceptability was high despite the technical problems in delivery. CONCLUSIONS With a small number of participants, this study showed few effects of an SMS-based brief intervention on peak risky single-occasion drinking. Nevertheless, the study highlights areas for further investigation into the effects of EMI on young adults with heavy alcohol consumption.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study focused on lapse shortly after an attempt to quit smoking. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies have mapped real-time situational factors that induce lapses in everyday life. However, the possible role of nonsmoking intention is disregarded in the dynamic context of daily life, whereas intention plays a key role in behavior change and shifts during smoking cessation. This study therefore aimed to capture the influence of intention on lapse, next to the known risk factors of negative affect, low self-efficacy, craving, positive outcome expectations towards smoking (POEs), being around smokers, and stress. It is hypothesized that scores on these factors shift during the day, especially shortly after quitting, which may induce lapse. Based on behavioral explanation models, intention is hypothesized to mediate the influence of the mentioned factors on lapse. METHODS An EMA study was conducted among 49 self-quitters in the first week of smoking cessation. RESULTS Generalized Linear Mixed Model regression analyses revealed that low nonsmoking intentions, low self-efficacy, and being around smokers (estimates were, respectively, -0.303, -0.331, and 2.083) predicted lapse. Nonsmoking intention partially mediated the influence of self-efficacy on lapse. Nonsmoking intention was predicted by not being around smokers, high self-efficacy, and low POEs (estimates were, respectively, -0.353, 0.293, and -0.072). CONCLUSIONS This small-scale EMA study confirms the importance of nonsmoking intention on lapse, next to self-efficacy and being around smokers. It adds insights into the mediating role of intention on the relationship between self-efficacy and lapse, and into the predictors of nonsmoking intention.},

Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the relationship between Black males' early contact with the criminal justice system through arrest on their probability of enrolling in a four-year college, using a nationally representative sample of approximately 1100 Black males who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (1997).

@article{Salas-Wright2015,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION Few, if any, studies have systematically examined the relationship between substance use and teen pregnancy using population-based samples. We aim to provide a comprehensive examination of substance use among pregnant adolescents in the United States. METHOD Employing data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health between 2002 and 2012 (n=97,850), we examine the prevalence of the past 12-month and the past 30-day substance use and substance use disorders among pregnant and non-pregnant adolescents (ages 12-17). We also examine psychosocial and pregnancy-related correlates of current substance use among the subsample of pregnant adolescents (n=810). RESULTS Pregnant teens were significantly more likely to have experimented with a variety of substances and meet criteria for alcohol (AOR=1.65, 95{\%} CI=1.26-2.17), cannabis (AOR=2.29, 95{\%} CI=1.72-3.04), and other illicit drug use disorders (AOR=2.84, 95{\%} CI=1.92-4.19). Pregnant early adolescents (ages 12-14; AOR=4.34, 95{\%} CI=2.28-8.26) were significantly more likely and pregnant late adolescents (ages 15-17; AOR=0.71, 95{\%} CI=0.56-0.90) significantly less likely than their non-pregnant counterparts to be current substance users. CONCLUSIONS Study findings point not only to a relationship between pregnancy and prior substance use, but also suggest that substance use continues for many teens during pregnancy. We found that substance use is particularly problematic among early adolescents and that the prevalence of substance use attenuates dramatically as youth progress from the first to the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.},

abstract = {Individuals reporting high levels of schizotypal personality traits appear to experience low subjective wellbeing, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to examine relationships between schizotypal traits and life satisfaction, and the possible role of negative affect. Two hundred and thirty-five healthy individuals completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, the Personal Wellbeing Index, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21. Schizotypal traits were associated with lower overall life satisfaction and satisfaction with specific life domains, and greater negative affect. After controlling for negative affect, global schizotypy and the negative and disorganised schizotypal factors were associated with lower overall life satisfaction. Diminished subjective wellbeing appears to be characteristic along the continuum of psychosis, even in individuals reporting subclinical manifestations of schizophrenic-like personality features. The fact that higher schizotypal traits correspond to low life satisfaction above what is explained by negative affective states indicates that there are other factors contributing to this relationship. Neurocognition and social cognition are the most obvious candidates for further exploration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The relationship between poor social functioning in schizophrenia and these individual differences in affectivity was also examined. 37 schizophrenic outpatients and 15 normal controls were assessed at a baseline evaluation and again approximately 90 days later. Consistent with a hypothesized decrease in hedonic capacity in schizophrenia, patients reported significantly greater physical and social anhedonia and less PA than controls. However, the schizophrenic group also reported significantly greater NA and social anxiety than did controls. These differences remained stable over the 90-day followup period. Within the schizophrenic group, physical and social anhedonia wee comparably negatively correlated with trait PA; however, social but not physical anhedonia was significantly positively correlated with HA and social anxiety. Poor social functioning in the schizophrenia group was associated with greater physical and social anhedonia and greater NA and social anxiety. Greater trait PA was related to better social functioning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995. pp. 79-109] are widely used to identify non-patient individuals who are hypothesized to possess heightened vulnerability to schizophrenia and related psychopathology. Yet surprisingly little is known about whether schizophrenia patients themselves show abnormalities on these scales across different clinical states, as would be expected for vulnerability indicators. Scores on four of the Psychosis Proneness Scales were evaluated at three assessment points over a 15-month period in healthy controls (n = 54) and in recent-onset schizophrenia patients (n = 72) who experienced symptom fluctuations across assessments. Patients showed steady elevations on the Physical Anhedonia Scale across time and clinical state, consistent with a stable vulnerability indicator. Patients had higher scores on the Perceptual Aberration and Magical Ideation Scales than controls throughout the follow-up period but scores also changed across clinical states, consistent with a mediating vulnerability indicator. Patients had higher scores on the Impulsive Non-Conformity Scale than controls only during a psychotic state, reflecting an episode indicator. The longitudinal characteristics of these scales in people who are actually diagnosed with schizophrenia provide key evidence for the validity of three commonly used psychometric indicators of vulnerability to psychosis.

abstract = {Whilst affective empathy is concerned with one's emotional response to the affective state of another, cognitive empathy refers to one's understanding of another's mental state, and deficits in both are believed to contribute to the social behavioral abnormalities associated with schizophrenia. The present study aimed to test whether individual differences in normally distributed schizotypal personality traits are related to cognitive and affective empathy, and whether any observed association between schizotypy and empathy mediates the relationship between schizotypy and (reduced) social functioning. Non-clinical volunteers (N = 223) completed measures of schizotypal personality, cognitive and affective empathy, social functioning and negative affect. The results indicated that higher schizotypy was associated with reduced empathy, poorer social functioning and increased negative affect. Of the specific schizotypal dimensions (positive, negative and disorganized), only negative schizotypy was significantly associated with social functioning, and this relationship persisted even after controlling for negative affect. Further, affective empathy functioned as a partial mediator in this relationship. These data show that the relationship between negative schizotypy and social functioning is at least partially attributable to deficits in affective empathy.

Some research suggested that individuals who experience stress, but who do not relapse, possess psychological characteristics and cognitive functioning that may be associated with effective coping. In particular, the use of problem-focused coping strategies has been associated with good neurocognitive functioning and has been shown to lessen the impact of stressful life events by lowering the risk of relapse. High levels of self-esteem, hope, and insight and the perception of available social support were found in schizophrenia patients who reported using active problem-focused coping strategies. Protective mechanisms, such as effective coping behaviors, in patients and their families may have changed stressful situations into more minor events and reduced the risk of relapse. Positive symptoms have been reduced in patients who consistently applied coping strategies to stressful life events and used problem-solving techniques. These findings support the importance of coping behavior as a protective factor and mediator in the vulnerability-stress-protective factors model. Despite good evidence for the value of using specific problem-focused coping strategies, schizophrenia patients may fail to use them. This differential use of coping strategies may explain the variability of schizophrenia patients' responses to stressful events. Even after training, they may continue to use ineffective strategies and report that the strategies they used most often were the least effective. Despite the fact that successful coping behaviors may be protective and can be learned, relatively few patients seem to avail themselves of the benefits of using coping strategies. In addition, because many schizophrenia patients have aversive reactions to stressful events, they may respond with avoidance and withdrawal to reduce their acute stress. Thus, further longitudinal research is needed to determine whether short-term or brief avoidance could in some way be adaptive or always leads to problems later.

abstract = {Background: Antipsychotic drugs are limited in their ability to improve negative symptoms, quality of life, and medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia. The addition of nonpharmacological interventions like social skills training has a positive effect on medication adherence and decreases rehospitalization rates but is limited in improving patients' symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and quality of life. Aerobic exercise, especially Tai-chi, can potentially reduce psychopathological and negative symptoms, decrease aggressive behaviors, and improve quality of life. It is an ideal rehabilitation intervention for patients with schizophrenia. However, no study has investigated the effects of social skills training plus Tai-chi on outcomes among outpatients with schizophrenia. This study analyzes the effect of antipsychotics combined with community-based integrated interventions on outcomes of schizophrenia. Methods: In this study, a 24-session social skills training plus Tai-chi was used in community settings among patients with schizophrenia. A total of 244 patients were randomly assigned to medication treatment alone (MTA group) or community-based integrated intervention (CBII group), which accepted social skills training plus Tai-chi in addition to medication treatment. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the intervention effect (group effect), intervention effect over time (time effect), and interaction effect (group × time effect). t tests were used to evaluate between-group differences on clinical variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the differences between the intervention at 12 months and baseline for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative symptoms and quality of life-social domain. Results: Compared with the MTA group, the CBII group had lower scores on PANSS (F = 17.312, p {\textless} 0.001) and negative symptoms (F = 44.909, p {\textless} 0.001), a lower risk for aggressive behavior (F = 12.382, p {\textless} 0.001), and a greater improvement in adherence to medication (F = 12.391, p {\textless} 0.001) after 1 year of intervention. The changes in PANSS total scores, negative scores, and social domain of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-Brief version (WHOQOL-BREF) from baseline to 12 months were significant between the two groups (PANSS total score: t = 4.839, p {\textless} 0.001; negative symptoms: t = 8.250, p {\textless} 0.001, and quality of life-social domain: t = -2.171, p = 0.031).

However, facilitation of adaptive coping with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia is an important part of mental health care in general and of psychiatric nursing in particular. This study explored factors of coping and examined their relation with symptom severity and with quality of life of outpatients with schizophrenia. Data were analyzed from a previous cross-sectional study, using the Ways of Coping Checklist, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Wisconsin Quality of Life Index. A principal component factor analysis was performed on the Ways of Coping Checklist scores, and the resulting six coping factors were then tested for correlations with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Wisconsin Quality of Life Index scores. Factors conceptually linked with emotion-focused coping were more strongly associated with symptom severity and with quality of life than were factors conceptually linked with problem-focused coping. The emotion-focused versus problem-focused coping framework was only partly explanatory. It may be fruitful to study whether supportive counseling enhances beneficial factors conceptually linked with emotion-focused coping of individuals with schizophrenia.

Thus, in order to improve outcomes, a better understanding of functional predictors is needed. This study examined negative affect, a construct comprised of negative emotional experience, as a predictor of social functioning across serious mental illnesses. One hundred twenty-seven participants with schizophrenia, 113 with schizoaffective disorder, 22 with psychosis not otherwise specified, 58 with bipolar disorder, and 84 healthy controls (N = 404) completed self-report negative affect measures. Elevated levels of negative affect were observed in clinical participants compared with healthy controls. For both clinical and healthy control participants, negative affect measures were significantly correlated with social functioning, and consistently explained significant amounts of variance in functioning. For clinical participants, this relationship persisted even after accounting for cognition and positive/negative symptoms. The findings suggest that negative affect is a strong predictor of outcome across these populations and treatment of serious mental illnesses should target elevated negative affect in addition to cognition and positive/negative symptoms.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Mechanisms of engagement and disengagement of attention to emotional information are thought to contribute to the onset and maintenance of anxiety and depression, a conclusion based largely on findings in analogue subclinical samples. However, we argue that traditionally defined analogue samples can be misleading. Firstly, research has challenged the adequacy of conventional measures of subclinical traits by illustrating that supposedly distinct scales are highly inter-correlated and do not therefore measure independent constructs. Secondly, recent research in clinical groups has revealed results opposite to those expected from the analogue literature, suggesting speeded, rather than impaired, disengagement from threat. METHODS We present analogue findings, from a sample of 70 healthy participants, allowing a purer distinction between the phenomenology of anxiety versus depression using the orthogonal traits of positive and negative affect to classify individuals. RESULTS Using emotional peripheral cueing we found that, at short cue durations, dysphoric individuals' (those with low positive and high negative affect) attention to facial expressions was slowed by emotional compared to neutral invalid cues. LIMITATIONS Limitations included a small sample size and limited generalisability due to sampling from a student population. CONCLUSIONS The data suggest that, in line with the previous subclinical literature, dysphoric individuals are slow to disengage attention from emotional information at early stages of processing and are consistent with the possibility that patterns of orienting of attention might be qualitatively different in subclinical versus clinical populations.},

Data from 291 female and 254 male participants diagnosed with PD were analyzed using a structured clinical interview following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria. Females with PD reported more SLEs including separation issues, physical illness or disability, and pregnancy-related problems than males. They also reported lower levels of confrontation and help-seeking coping strategies and higher levels of agoraphobia in symptom severity than males. The HRQOL of females with PD was significantly lower than male in physical functioning of HRQOL. This study suggests that the patient's sex is relevant to the assessment and treatment of PD.

The Chapman Scales for Psychosis Proneness were administered to 1541 college students at baseline, and subsequently at six-monthly intervals up to 18months. Latent class growth analysis was conducted to track the different trajectories. In addition, self-reported scales were used to measure idea of reference, emotional experiences and expression, stress and coping, as well as social functioning.

These findings suggest that there may be distinct developmental trajectories for schizotypy.

Protective factors against the effects of stress might be the key to understanding some inconclusive findings and to the development of optimal psychosocial interventions. The present study compared self-reported levels of stress, self-esteem, social support and active coping in 32 patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP), 30 individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR) and 30 healthy controls. Associations with symptoms of psychosis were assessed in both patient groups. Individuals at UHR reported significantly higher stress levels compared to FEP patients. Both patient groups showed lower self-esteem compared to controls, and the UHR group reported lower social support and active coping than controls. These group differences could not be explained by age and dose of antipsychotic medication in the FEP group. In the UHR group, higher stress levels and lower self-esteem were associated with more severe positive and depressive symptoms on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Multiple regression analyses revealed that stress was the only significant predictor for both symptom measures and that the relationship was not moderated by self-esteem. Our findings show that individuals at UHR for psychosis experience high levels of psychosocial stress and marked deficits in protective factors. The results suggest that psychosocial interventions targeted at reducing stress levels and improving resilience in this population may be beneficial in improving outcomes.

abstract = {According to various diathesis-stress models of schizophrenia, life stress plays a defining role in the onset and course of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. In this regard, individual differences in coping strategies and affective traits, variables related to the management and experience of stress, may play a large role in susceptibility to the disorder and symptom exacerbation. Furthermore, it has been posited that cognitive deficits may limit an individuals' ability to effectively respond to stressful situations. We investigated the relationships between attention, immediate memory, trait negative affect (NA), trait positive affect (PA) and specific coping strategies within three groups: chronic schizophrenia patients (n = 27), psychometrically-defined schizotypy (n = 89), and schizotypy demographically-matched controls (n = 26). As hypothesized affective traits displayed predictable relationships with specific coping strategies, such that NA was associated with the greater use of avoidant coping strategies within the schizophrenia and schizotypy group, while PA was associated with greater use of approach coping styles within all groups. The schizotypy group reported significantly higher levels of NA and also greater use of avoidant coping strategies than both the control and schizophrenia group. As expected group differences were found in trait affect, coping strategies, and cognitive functioning. Importantly, these group differences remained significant even when demographic variables were entered as covariates. Contrary to our expectations, cognitive functioning displayed only a few tenuous relationships with coping strategies within the schizophrenia and schizotypy groups. Overall, results support the notion that affective traits and not cognitive functioning is the best predictor of approach and avoidant coping strategies.

The current project was designed to explore specific psychosocial and biological mechanisms through which early adversity might prospectively shape physical health in adulthood. Study 1 used longitudinal data from a community sample to show that cumulative experiences of early adversity, as measured by contemporaneous maternal report, predicted poor self-reported and interviewer-rated physical health in young adults. Results suggested that early adverse experiences led to ongoing stress in social and nonsocial (e.g., academic) contexts, which in turn portended poor health. Elevated depressive symptoms accounted, in large part, for the effects of ongoing social stress on later risk for poor health. Study 2, using a subset of the Study 1 sample, showed that individuals who experienced early adversity tended to have higher depressive symptoms partially as a result of close friendships with individuals with mental health problems. Study 3 examined the day-to-day dynamics of interpersonal and biological mechanisms of the effects of early adversity on physical health in a sample of college students. Results suggested that young adults who have experienced stressful family environments reported more instances of reassurance-seeking, aggression, and withdrawal on a day-to-day basis. In addition, early adversity predicted higher daily reports of negative affect. Together, these findings support the notion that early adversity can have a long-lasting impact on patterns of psychological, social, and biological functioning, and that early adversity and ongoing stress might contribute to poor physical health in part through their effects on social relationships and mood. Results have implications for the development of targeted interventions designed to prevent the long-term emotional and physical consequences of early life stress.

Emotion recognition, 'theory of mind,' executive functioning, 'crystallized' verbal intelligence, psychopathology, and social behavior were assessed in patients with schizophrenia compared with a healthy control group. Patients were significantly impaired on all tasks involving executive functioning, emotion recognition, and 'theory of mind.' Impaired executive functioning did, however, only partially account for the deficits in social perception and social cognition. Social perception and cognition in schizophrenia predicted the odds of being a patient significantly better than nonsocial cognition. Severe social behavioral abnormalities were linked to the duration of the illness, and even more so to 'theory of mind' deficits. Considering impaired social perception and social cognition significantly contributes to the understanding of social behavioral problems in schizophrenia.

Methods: Data came from the Suffolk County Mental Health Project, a 20-year prospective study of first-admission patients with psychotic disorders. A never-psychotic comparison group was also assessed. Latent class growth analysis was applied to longitudinal data on social functioning from 485 respondents with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and psychotic mood disorders, and associations of the empirically derived trajectories with premorbid social adjustment, diagnosis, and 20-year outcomes were examined. Results: Four mostly stable trajectories of preserved (N = 82; 59th percentile of comparison group sample distribution), moderately impaired (N = 148; 17th percentile), severely impaired (N = 181; 3rd percentile), and profoundly impaired (N = 74; 1st percentile) functioning best described the 20-year course of social functioning across diagnoses. The outcome in the group with preserved functioning did not differ from that of never-psychotic individuals at 20 years, but the other groups functioned significantly worse. Differences among trajectories were already evident in childhood. The two most impaired trajectories started to diverge in early adolescence. Poorer social functioning trajectories were strongly associated with other real-world outcomes at 20 years. Multiple trajectories were represented within each disorder. However, more participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders had impaired trajectories, and more with mood disorders had better functioning trajectories. Conclusions: The results highlight substantial variability of social outcomes within diagnoses—albeit overall worse social outcomes in schizophrenia spectrum disorders—and show remarkably stable long-term impairments in social functioning after illness onset across all diagnoses.

Consequently, much recent research has attempted to identify factors that may contribute to functional outcome; social cognition is one such domain. The purpose of this article is to review research examining the relationship between social cognition and functional outcome. Comprehensive searches of PsycINFO and MEDLINE/PUBMED were conducted to identify relevant published manuscripts to include in the current review. It is concluded that the relationship between social cognition and functional outcome depends on the specific domains of each construct examined; however, it can generally be concluded that there are clear and consistent relationships between aspects of functional outcome and social cognition. These findings are discussed in light of treatment implications for schizophrenia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Individuals with schizophrenia (n = 55) and depression (n = 34) were evaluated at baseline during hospitalization and compared with nonpsychiatric control participants (n = 41). Participants were assessed again at a 1-year follow-up. At baseline, compared with control participants, individuals with schizophrenia and depression were both characterized by elevated SA, greater NA, and lower PA. In schizophrenic individuals, elevated SA remained stable over the follow-up. However, in recovered depressed patients, SA declined over the follow-up period. Group differences remained in NA and PA over the 1-year follow-up. These results support the view that elevated SA is enduring in schizophrenia but that elevated SA is transiently related to clinical status in depression.

Participants completed a questionnaire set composed of the Beck Depression Inventory, Cognitive Triad Inventory, The Ways of Coping Scale, Conflict Tendency Scale, and Form of Conflict in Close Relationships. According to the model, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with emotion-focused coping and negative cognitive triad, both of which were related with conflict tendency that was in turn associated with conflict frequency. The model explained 24{\%} of the variance in conflict frequency. In future studies and psychotherapy practice, depressive symptoms, emotion-focused coping, and negative attributions about the self, others, and the future should be taken into account with regard to interpersonal conflict.

Using a correlational approach, the present study explored the relationship between schizotypal traits, ToM, neurocognition, depressed mood, and social functioning in a sample of 50 undergraduate students. Schizotypy was related to poor social functioning. Contrary to predictions, schizotypal traits were not associated with impaired ToM. In fact, schizotypal traits were associated with enhanced performance on a ToM task that involved detection of ironic statements. However, strong relationships emerged among schizotypy, depressed mood, and social functioning, highlighting the need to also examine depression when assessing the relations between elevated schizotypy and poor social functioning.

The authors outline the components that a valid negative symptom construct requires: (a) replicable relationships with observable phenomena and other constructs; (b) good reliability, temporal stability, and homogeneity; and (c) predict prognosis and response to treatment, possess convergent and discriminant validity, and utility for clinicians. Recent findings provide support for the validity of the construct, but the data suggest that there is a highly correlated set of negative symptoms (e.g., flat affect, alogia, anhedonia, and avolition). Primary and enduring symptoms have good predictive and discriminant validity, and can be studied in the context of the deficit syndrome, as well as with current negative symptom rating scales. It is suggested that future studies should examine whether deficit negative symptoms are better conceptualized as a dimension or a category, elucidate the relationship between deficit symptoms and additional clinical and behavioral variables (e.g., response to newer neuroleptic medications and diminished emotional responding), and explore differences between the pattern of correlates of deficit symptoms, positive, and thought disorder symptoms.

An important impediment to the widespread adoption of Bayesian tests is arguably the lack of user-friendly software for the run-of-the-mill statistical problems that confront psychologists for the analysis of almost every experiment: the t-test, ANOVA, correlation, regression, and contingency tables. In Part II of this series we introduce JASP (http://www.jasp-stats.org), an open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly graphical software package that allows users to carry out Bayesian hypothesis tests for standard statistical problems. JASP is based in part on the Bayesian analyses implemented in Morey and Rouder's BayesFactor package for R.

For almost 30 years, theoreticians and applied researchers have advocated for centering as an effective way to reduce the correlation between variables and thus produce more stable estimates of regression coefficients. By reviewing the theory on which this recommendation is based, this article presents three new findings. First, that the original assumption of expectation-independence among predictors on which this recommendation is based can be expanded to encompass many other joint distributions. Second, that for many jointly distributed random variables, even some that enjoy considerable symmetry, the correlation between the centered main effects and their respective interaction can increase when compared with the correlation of the uncentered effects.

First, an online survey of 101 students found that students' beliefs about the probability curve within a CI take a variety of shapes, and that in fixed choice tasks, 39{\%} CI [30, 48] of students' responses deviated from true distributions. For open ended tasks, this proportion rose to 85{\%}, 95{\%} CI [76, 90]. We interpret this as evidence that, for many students, intuitions about CIs distributions are ill-formed, and their responses are highly susceptible to question format. Many students also falsely believed that there is substantial change in likelihood at the upper and lower limits of the CI, resembling a cliff effect (Rosenthal and Gaito, 1963; Nelson et al., 1986). In a follow-up study, a subset of 24 postgraduate students participated in a 45-min semi-structured interview discussing the students' responses to the survey. Analysis of interview transcripts identified several competing intuitions about CIs, and several new CI misconceptions. During the interview, we also introduced an interactive teaching program displaying a cat's eye CI, that is, a CI that uses normal distributions to depict the correct likelihood distribution. Cat's eye CIs were designed to help students understand likelihood distributions and the relationship between interval length, C{\%} level and sample size. Observed changes in students' intuitions following this teaching program suggest that a brief intervention using cat's eyes can reduce CI misconceptions and increase accurate CI intuitions.},

In the present study, 66 PhD students were asked to interpret statistical outcomes presented as CIs or as conventional statistics (t statistics and associated p values). Fewer misinterpretations of statistics-such as accepting the null hypothesis-and more references to effect size were found when results were presented as CIs. Furthermore, participants tended to be more certain about the existence of a population effect in the expected direction and about the replicability of the results when the results were presented following the conventions of NHST than when presented using CIs. Contrary to expectations, no evidence of a more precipitous drop in the belief of the existence of a population effect and replic-ability estimates when p values exceeded the significance level of .05 was found when data were presented using NHST instead of by CIs.},

abstract = {A survey in the United States revealed that an alarmingly large percentage of university psychologists admitted having used questionable research practices that can contaminate the research literature with false positive and biased findings. We conducted a replication of this study among Italian research psychologists to investigate whether these findings generalize to other countries. All the original materials were translated into Italian, and members of the Italian Association of Psychology were invited to participate via an online survey. The percentages of Italian psychologists who admitted to having used ten questionable research practices were similar to the results obtained in the United States although there were small but significant differences in self-admission rates for some QRPs. Nearly all researchers (88{\%}) admitted using at least one of the practices, and researchers generally considered a practice possibly defensible if they admitted using it, but Italian researchers were much less likely than US researchers to consider a practice defensible. Participants' estimates of the percentage of researchers who have used these practices were greater than the self-admission rates, and participants estimated that researchers would be unlikely to admit it. In written responses, participants argued that some of these practices are not questionable and they have used some practices because reviewers and journals demand it. The similarity of results obtained in the United States, this study, and a related study conducted in Germany suggest that adoption of these practices is an international phenomenon and is likely due to systemic features of the international research and publication processes.},

To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

The vast majority (96{\%}) of articles that report P values in the abstract, full text, or both include some values of .05 or less.1 However, many of the claims that these reports highlight are likely false.2 Recognizing the major importance of the statistical significance conundrum, the American Statistical Association (ASA) published3 a statement on P values in 2016. The status quo is widely believed to be problematic, but how exactly to fix the problem is far more contentious. The contributors to the ASA statement also wrote 20 independent, accompanying commentaries focusing on different aspects and prioritizing different solutions. Another large coalition of 72 methodologists recently proposed4 a specific, simple move: lowering the routine P value threshold for claiming statistical significance from .05 to .005 for new discoveries. The proposal met with strong endorsement in some circles and concerns in others.},

However, it still remains somewhat vague as to what exactly BC are, how they can or even should be explored, and why their understanding matters. This research tackles these important questions by means of an in-depth theoretical-methodological analysis. The study contributes fourfold to organizational research methods: First, it develops a more accurate and explicit understanding of BC. Second, it widens the understanding of how BC can be explored by suggesting and juxtaposing new tools and approaches. It also illustrates BC-exploring processes, drawing on two empirical case examples. Third, it analyzes the reasons for exploring BC, concluding that BC exploration fosters theory development, strengthens research validity, and mitigates the research-practice gap. Fourth, it synthesizes the analyses into 12 tentative suggestions for how scholars should subsequently approach the issues surrounding BC. The authors hope that the study contributes to consensus shifting with respect to BC and draws more attention to BC. },

Certainly, the practice of science needs to be improved, and scientists are now pursuing this goal. However, in this perspective, we argue that this seeming paradox is not new, has always been part of the way science works, and likely will remain so. We first introduce the paradox. We then review a wide range of challenges that appear to make scientific success difficult. Next, we describe the factors that make science work—in the past, present, and pre-sumably also in the future. We then suggest that remedies for the present practice of science need to be applied selectively so as not to slow progress and illustrate with a few examples. We conclude with arguments that communication of science needs to empha-size not just problems but the enormous successes and benefits that science has brought and is now bringing to all elements of modern society. scientometrics | science history | scientific progress | reproducibility | science communication},

Nevertheless, a minority of studies have failed to replicate this effect. This article attempts to resolve the inconsistent results by introducing a novel variant of proponent-skeptic collaboration. The proposed approach combines the features of adversarial collaboration and purely confirmatory preregistered research. Prior to data collection, the adversaries reached consensus on an optimal research design, formulated their expectations, and agreed to submit the findings to an academic journal regardless of the outcome. To increase transparency and secure the purely confirmatory nature of the investigation, the 2 parties set up a publicly available adversarial collaboration agreement that detailed the proposed design and all foreseeable aspects of the data analysis. As anticipated by the skeptics, a series of Bayesian hypothesis tests indicated that horizontal eye movements did not improve free recall performance. The skeptics suggested that the nonreplication may partly reflect the use of suboptimal and questionable research practices in earlier eye movement studies. The proponents countered this suggestion and used a p curve analysis to argue that the effect of horizontal eye movements on explicit memory did not merely reflect selective reporting.},

Indeed, research of two prominent types, sexy hypothesis testing and model testing, is often characterized by low priors (due to astounding hypotheses and conjunctive models) as well as low-likelihood ratios (due to nondiagnostic predictions of the yin-or-yang type).

In this article, we compare Case IV to two other comparable procedures: the first correction (the expectation maximization algorithm) requires raw data about the selection variables used to form a suitability judgment. The second, the Pearson-Lawley correction, requires the variance-covariance matrix of the selection variables. We show that even when the variables used for selection are unobserved or unavailable, it is still possible to estimate parameters without making the restrictive assumptions of Case IV. In addition, these two corrections almost always outperform Case IV, particularly when the critical assumption of Case IV is violated. We also provide R code illustrating the use of these correction procedures.},

@article{pfaffel_missing_2016,
abstract = {A recurring methodological problem in the evaluation of the predictive validity of selection methods is that the values of the criterion variable are available for selected applicants only. This so-called range restriction problem causes biased population estimates. Correction methods for direct and indirect range restriction scenarios have widely studied for continuous criterion variables but not for dichotomous ones. The few existing approaches are inapplicable because they do not consider the unknown base rate of success. Hence, there is a lack of scientific research on suitable correction methods and the systematic analysis of their accuracies in the cases of a naturally or artificially dichotomous criterion. We aim to overcome this deficiency by viewing the range restriction problem as a missing data mechanism. We used multiple imputation by chained equations to generate complete criterion data before estimating the predictive validity and the base rate of success. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to investigate the accuracy of the proposed correction in dependence of selection ratio, predictive validity, and base rate of success in an experimental design. In addition, we compared our proposed missing data approach with Thorndike's well-known correction formulas that have only been used in the case of continuous criterion variables so far. The results show that the missing data approach is more accurate in estimating the predictive validity than Thorndike's correction formulas. The accuracy of our proposed correction increases as the selection ratio and the correlation between predictor and criterion increase. Furthermore, the missing data approach provides a valid estimate of the unknown base rate of success. On the basis of our findings, we argue for the use of multiple imputation by chained equations in the evaluation of the predictive validity of selection methods when the criterion is dichotomous.},

abstract = {Empirically analyzing empirical evidence One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {\textless}.05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47{\%} of original effect sizes were in the 95{\%} confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39{\%} of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68{\%} with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater}Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

@article{trafimow_using_2017,
abstract = {There has been much controversy over the null hypothesis significance testing procedure, with much of the criticism centered on the problem of inverse inference. Specifically, p gives the probability of the finding (or one more extreme) given the null hypothesis, whereas the null hypothesis significance testing procedure involves drawing a conclusion about the null hypothesis given the finding. Many critics have called for null hypothesis significance tests to be replaced with confidence intervals. However, confidence intervals also suffer from a version of the inverse inference problem. The only known solution to the inverse inference problem is to use the famous theorem by Bayes, but this involves commitments that many researchers are not willing to make. However, it is possible to ask a useful question for which inverse inference is not a problem and that leads to the computation of the coefficient of confidence. In turn, and much more important, using the coefficient of confidence implies the desirability of switching from the current emphasis on a posteriori inferential statistics to an emphasis on a priori inferential statistics.},

@book{harlow_what_2016,
abstract = {The classic edition of What If There Were No Significance Tests? highlights current statistical inference practices. Four areas are featured as essential for making inferences: sound judgment, meaningful research questions, relevant design, and assessing fit in multiple ways. Other options (data visualization, replication or meta-analysis), other features (mediation, moderation, multiple levels or classes), and other approaches (Bayesian analysis, simulation, data mining, qualitative inquiry) are also suggested. The Classic Edition's new Introduction demonstrates the ongoing relevance of the topic and the charge to move away from an exclusive focus on NHST, along with new methods to help make significance testing more accessible to a wider body of researchers to improve our ability to make more accurate statistical inferences. Part 1 presents an overview of significance testing issues. The next part discusses the debate in which significance testing should be rejected or retained. The third part outlines various methods that may supplement significance testing procedures. Part 4 discusses Bayesian approaches and methods and the use of confidence intervals versus significance tests. The book concludes with philosophy of science perspectives. Rather than providing definitive prescriptions, the chapters are largely suggestive of general issues, concerns, and application guidelines. The editors allow readers to choose the best way to conduct hypothesis testing in their respective fields. For anyone doing research in the social sciences, this book is bound to become "must" reading. Ideal for use as a supplement for graduate courses in statistics or quantitative analysis taught in psychology, education, business, nursing, medicine, and the social sciences, the book also benefits independent researchers in the behavioral and social sciences and those who teach statistics.},

A simulation was presented to assess the potential costs and benefits of a restrictive strategy, which makes minimal use of auxiliary variables, versus an inclusive strategy, which makes liberal use of such variables. The simulation showed that the inclusive strategy is to be greatly preferred. With an inclusive strategy not only is there a reduced chance of inadvertently omitting an important cause of missingness, there is also the possibility of noticeable gains in terms of increased efficiency and reduced bias, with only minor costs. As implemented in currently available software, the ML approach tends to encourage the use of a restrictive strategy, whereas the MI approach makes it relatively simple to use an inclusive strategy.},

abstract = {Classic parametric statistical significance tests, such as analysis of variance and least squares regression, are widely used by researchers in many disciplines, including psychology. For classic parametric tests to produce accurate results, the assumptions underlying them (e.g., normality and homoscedasticity) must be satisfied. These assumptions are rarely met when analyzing real data. The use of classic parametric methods with violated assumptions can result in the inaccurate computation of p values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals. This may lead to substantive errors in the interpretation of data. Many modern robust statistical methods alleviate the problems inherent in using parametric methods with violated assumptions, yet modern methods are rarely used by researchers. The authors examine why this is the case, arguing that most researchers are unaware of the serious limitations of classic methods and are unfamiliar with modern alternatives. A range of modern robust and rank-based significance tests suitable for analyzing a wide range of designs is introduced. Practical advice on conducting modern analyses using software such as SPSS, SAS, and R is provided. The authors conclude by discussing robust effect size indices.},

abstract = {Compelling arguments for reform of statistical practices have been made in many disciplines, in some cases over several decades, but achieving reform has proved difficult. We discuss how reform has progressed—or not progressed—in psychology, medicine, and ecology and describe case studies of attempts by pioneering journal editors to change statistical practices. Lessons for those seeking reform in education include the need to recognize the importance of journal editors and of provision of articles, books, and software that give practical guidance to researchers wishing to use the recommended statistical techniques. Research is required on recommended techniques so that statistical practice can become evidence based. Also, improvement in statistical practice should be encouraged along with improvement in the way a discipline theorizes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Scores on the SAT (a test widely used in the admissions process in the United States), secondary school grades, college grades, and SES measures from 143,606 students at 110 colleges and universities were examined, and results of these analyses were compared with results obtained using a 41-school data set including scores from the prior version of the SAT and using University of California data from prior research on the role of SES. In all the data sets, the SAT showed incremental validity over secondary school grades in predicting subsequent academic performance, and this incremental relationship was not substantially affected by controlling for SES. The SES of enrolled students was very similar to that of specific schools' applicant pools, which suggests that the barrier to college for low-SES students in the United States is a lower rate of entering the college admissions process, rather than exclusion on the part of colleges.},

abstract = {The cross-product term in moderated regression may be collinear with its constituent parts, making it difficult to detect main, simple, and interaction effects. The literature shows that mean-centering can reduce the covariance between the linear and the interaction terms, thereby suggesting that it reduces collinearity. We analytically prove that mean-centering neither changes the computational precision of parameters, the sampling accuracy of main effects, simple effects, interaction effects, nor the R2. We also show that the determinants of the cross product matrix X′ X are identical for uncentered and mean-centered data, so the collinearity problem in the moderated regression is unchanged by mean-centering. Many empirical marketing researchers commonly mean-center their moderated regression data hoping that this will improve the precision of estimates from ill conditioned, collinear data, but unfortunately, this hope is futile. Therefore, researchers using moderated regression models should not mean-center in a specious attempt to mitigate collinearity between the linear and the interaction terms. Of course, researchers may wish to mean-center for interpretive purposes and other reasons.},

@incollection{behrens_exploratory_2003,
abstract = {In contrast to statistical approaches aimed at testing specific hypotheses, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a quantitative tradition that seeks to help researchers understand data when little or no statistical hypotheses exist, or when specific hypotheses exist but supplemental representations are needed to ensure the interpretability of statistical results. In this way, EDA seeks to answer the broad scientific questions of “what is going on here” and “how might I be fooled by my statistical results.” The techniques of EDA are discussed following the “4 Rs” of Revelation (graphics), Re-expression (scale transformation), Residuals (model building and assessment), and Resistance (using summaries unaffected by unexpected values). The philosophical justification for EDA is presented in terms of C.S. Pierce's concept of abduction and the recognition of a broad range of analytic needs that arise throughout the research process. Several previously published datasets from psychological literature are re-analyzed to illustrate the interpretive errors that can occur when techniques of EDA are omitted. In general, these errors occur because researchers unwittingly assume the existence of structure that is not supported by the data. Using the techniques of EDA, however, underlying structure is brought to the researcher's attention and appropriate interpretation can be obtained.},

abstract = {Additive transformations are often offered as a remedy for the common problem of collinearity in moderated regression and polynomial regression analysis. As the authors demonstrate in this article, mean-centering reduces nonessential collinearity but not essential collinearity. Therefore, in most cases, mean-centering of predictors does not accomplish its intended goal. In this article, the authors discuss and explain, through derivation of equations and empirical examples, that mean-centering changes lower order regression coefficients but not the highest order coefficients, does not change the fit of regression models, does not impact the power to detect moderating effects, and does not alter the reliability of product terms. The authors outline the positive effects of mean-centering, namely, the increased interpretability of the results and its importance for moderator analysis in structural equations and multilevel analysis. It is recommended that researchers center their predictor variables when their variables do not have meaningful zero-points within the range of the variables to assist in interpreting the results.},

The first edition of Statistical Analysis with Missing Data has been a standard reference on missing-data methods. Now, reflecting extensive developments in Bayesian methods for simulating posterior distributions, this Second Edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers a thoroughly up-to-date, reorganized survey of current methodology for handling missing-data problems. Blending theory and application, authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe rigorous yet simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing-data mechanism and apply the theory to a wide range of important missing-data problems. The new edition now enlarges its coverage to include: Expanded coverage of Bayesian methodology, both theoretical and computational, and of multiple imputation Analysis of data with missing values where inferences are based on likelihoods derived from formal statistical models for the data-generating and missing-data mechanisms Applications of the approach in a variety of contexts including regression, factor analysis, contingency table analysis, time series, and sample survey inference Extensive references, examples, and exercises Amstat News asked three review editors to rate their top five favorite books in the September 2003 issue.

In published articles, however, little information tends to be reported on whether the data satisfy the assumptions underlying the statistical techniques used. This could be due to self-selection: Only manuscripts with data fulfilling the assumptions are submitted. Another, more disquieting, explanation would be that violations of assumptions are hardly checked for in the first place. In this article a study is presented on whether and how 30 researchers checked fictitious data for violations of assumptions in their own working environment. They were asked to analyze the data as they would their own data, for which often used and well-known techniques like the t-procedure, ANOVA and regression were required. It was found that they hardly ever checked for violations of assumptions. Interviews afterwards revealed that mainly lack of knowledge and nonchalance, rather than more rational reasons like being aware of the robustness of a technique or unfamiliarity with an alternative, seem to account for this behavior. These data suggest that merely encouraging people to check for violations of assumptions will not lead them to do so, and that the use of statistics is opportunistic.},

abstract = { The veracity of substantive research claims hinges on the way experimental data are collected and analyzed. In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychology's academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result—a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label “confirmatory,” and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled “exploratory.” We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception. },

We compute Bayes factors—a quantity that can be used to express comparative evidence for an hypothesis but also for the null hypothesis—for a large subset (N = 72) of the original papers and their corresponding replication attempts. In our computation, we take into account the likely scenario that publication bias had distorted the originally published results. Overall, 75{\%} of studies gave qualitatively similar results in terms of the amount of evidence provided. However, the evidence was often weak (i.e., Bayes factor {\textless} 10). The majority of the studies (64{\%}) did not provide strong evidence for either the null or the alternative hypothesis in either the original or the replication, and no replication attempts provided strong evidence in favor of the null. In all cases where the original paper provided strong evidence but the replication did not (15{\%}), the sample size in the replication was smaller than the original. Where the replication provided strong evidence but the original did not (10{\%}), the replication sample size was larger. We conclude that the apparent failure of the Reproducibility Project to replicate many target effects can be adequately explained by overestimation of effect sizes (or overestimation of evidence against the null hypothesis) due to small sample sizes and publication bias in the psychological literature. We further conclude that traditional sample sizes are insufficient and that a more widespread adoption of Bayesian methods is desirable.},

The analytic scheme requires isolating four types of constituents in a display, and specifying their structure and interrelations at a syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic level of analysis. As the description is constructed, one checks for violations of ‘acceptability principles', which are derived from facts about human visual information processing and from an analysis of the nature of symbols. Violations of these principles reveal the source of potential difficulties in using a display.},

abstract = {Traditional Null Hypothesis Testing procedures are poorly adapted to theory testing. The methodology can mislead researchers in several ways, including: (a) a lack of power can result in an erroneous rejection of the theory; (b) the focus on directionality (ordinal tests) rather than more precise quantitative predictions limits the information gained; and (c) the misuse of probability values to indicate effect size. An alternative approach is proposed which involves employing the theory to generate explicit effect size predictions that are compared to the effect size estimates and related confidence intervals to test the theoretical predictions. This procedure is illustrated employing the Transtheoretical Model. Data from a sample (N = 3,967) of smokers from a large New England HMO system were used to test the model. There were a total of 15 predictions evaluated, each involving the relation between Stage of Change and one of the other 15 Transtheoretical Model variables. For each variable, omega-squared and the related confidence interval were calculated and compared to the predicted effect sizes. Eleven of the 15 predictions were confirmed, providing support for the theoretical model. Quantitative predictions represent a much more direct, informative, and strong test of a theory than the traditional test of significance.},

abstract = {A quiet methodological revolution, a modeling revolution, has occurred over the past several decades, almost without discussion. In contrast, the 20th century ended with contentious argument over the utility of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The NHST controversy may have been at least partially irrelevant, because in certain ways the modeling revolution obviated the NHST argument. I begin with a history of NHST and modeling and their relation to one another. Next, I define and illustrate principles involved in developing and evaluating mathematical models. Following, I discuss the difference between using statistical procedures within a rule-based framework and building mathematical models from a scientific epistemology. Only the former is treated carefully in most psychology graduate training. The pedagogical implications of this imbalance and the revised pedagogy required to account for the modeling revolution are described. To conclude, I discuss how attention to modeling implies shifting statistical practice in certain progressive ways. The epistemological basis of statistics has moved away from being a set of procedures, applied mechanistically, and moved toward building and evaluating statistical and scientific models.},

Exploratory data analysis and the use of graphic methods, a steady improvement in and a movement toward standardization in measurement, an emphasis on estimating effect sizes using confidence intervals, and the informed use of available statistical methods are suggested.

The most visible argument that SS is not an index of replicability, one that is based in notions of Bayesian statistical inference, is considered and shown to be flawed. Two different arguments are presented that demonstrate the irrelevance of SS to replicability: (a) SS may not be taken as a sign of the truth of the research hypothesis; and (b) statistical significance tests do not generate verifiable predictions of replication attempts. Direct tests of replicability and effect-size measures of replicability are shown to have comparable problems. A solution to the replicability problem is proposed for atheoretical research that replaces `once-and-for-all' tests of replicability with the requirement that the treatment effect be demonstrable (a) in the individual, (b) on a continuing basis, and (c) in a way that is clearly discernible.

One possibility is to use selective attention to process only the most relevant incoming information. A complementary strategy is to represent sets of objects as a group or ensemble (e.g. represent the average size of items). Recent studies have established that the visual system computes accurate ensemble representations across a variety of feature domains and current research aims to determine how these representations are computed, why they are computed and where they are coded in the brain. Ensemble representations enhance visual cognition in many ways, making ensemble coding a crucial mechanism for coping with the limitations on visual processing. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Null hypothesis significance testing remains a popular strategy, but the majority of authors reported a standardized or unstandardized effect size measure alongside their significance test results. Confidence intervals on effect sizes were infrequently employed. Many authors provided minimal details about their statistical analyses and less than a third of the articles presented on data complications such as missing data and violations of statistical assumptions.

Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial.

Reform is especially challenging because many statistics teachers in psychology first need to achieve conceptual change themselves. In relation to a highly desirable increase in use of confidence intervals (CIs), it seems that many psychologists do not understand CIs well, and guidelines for CI use are lacking. The conceptual change model is offered to guide research needed on many aspects of reform, and the important and exciting task of the statistical re-education of psychology. PSYCHOLOGY MUST MOVE BEYOND FLAWED NHST PRACTICES Psychology is addicted to null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), despite decades of criticism of the technique, and evidence that NHST is widely misunderstood and has caused great damage. Finch, Thomason, and Cumming (in press) and Nickerson (2000) gave reviews. Important changes may now at last be possible, with the American Psychological Association},

Certainly, the practice of science needs to be improved, and scientists are now pursuing this goal. However, in this perspective, we argue that this seeming paradox is not new, has always been part of the way science works, and likely will remain so. We first introduce the paradox. We then review a wide range of challenges that appear to make scientific success difficult. Next, we describe the factors that make science work—in the past, present, and pre-sumably also in the future. We then suggest that remedies for the present practice of science need to be applied selectively so as not to slow progress and illustrate with a few examples. We conclude with arguments that communication of science needs to empha-size not just problems but the enormous successes and benefits that science has brought and is now bringing to all elements of modern society. scientometrics | science history | scientific progress | reproducibility | science communication},

If theoretical predictions are weak we should not rely on all or nothing hypothesis tests. Different inferential methods may be most suitable for different types of research questions. Whenever researchers use NHST they should justify its use, and publish pre-study power calculations and effect sizes, including negative findings. Hypothesis-testing studies should be pre-registered and optimally raw data published. The current statistics lite educational approach for students that has sustained the widespread, spurious use of NHST should be phased out. Instead, we should encourage either more in-depth statistical training of more researchers and/or more widespread involvement of professional statisticians in all research.},

This paradox exists because most management theories make predictions that are merely directional, such as stating that two variables will be positively or negatively related. As methodological rigor increases, the probability that an estimated effect will differ from zero likewise increases, and the likelihood of finding support for a directional prediction boils down to a coin toss. This paradox can be resolved by developing theories with greater precision, such that their propositions predict something more meaningful than deviations from zero. This article evaluates the precision of theories in management research, offers guidelines for making theories more precise, and discusses ways to overcome barriers to the pursuit of theoretical precision.},

Local independence, expected value true scores, and nondeterministic functions of observed variables are three types of definitions for latent variables. These definitions are reviewed and an alternative “sample realizations” definition is presented. Another section briefly describes identification, latent variable indeterminancy, and other properties common to models with latent variables. The paper then reviews the role of latent variables in multiple regression, probit and logistic regression, factor analysis, latent curve models, item response theory, latent class analysis, and structural equation models. Though these application areas are diverse, the paper highlights the similarities as well as the differences in the manner in which the latent variables are defined and used. It concludes with an evaluation of the different definitions of latent variables and their properties.},

Yet, based on a review of more than a decade of empirical research in the Strategic Management Journal, we find that few papers econometrically correct for such endogeneity. In response, we now describe the endogeneity problem for cross-sectional and panel data, referring specifically to management's choice among discrete strategies with continuous performance outcomes. We then present readily implementable econometric methods to correct for endogeneity and, when feasible, provide STATA code to ease implementation. We also discuss extensions and nuances of these models that are sometimes difficult to decipher in more standard treatments. These extensions are not typically discussed in the strategy literature, but they are, in fact, highly pertinent to empirical strategic management research.},

abstract = {A statistically significant result, and a non-significant result may differ little, although significance status may tempt an interpretation of difference. Two studies are reported that compared interpretation of such results presented using null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), or confidence intervals (CIs). Authors of articles published in psychology, behavioral neuroscience, and medical journals were asked, via email, to interpret two fictitious studies that found similar results, one statistically significant, and the other non-significant. Responses from 330 authors varied greatly, but interpretation was generally poor, whether results were presented as CIs or using NHST. However, when interpreting CIs respondents who mentioned NHST were 60{\%} likely to conclude, unjustifiably, the two results conflicted, whereas those who interpreted CIs without reference to NHST were 95{\%} likely to conclude, justifiably, the two results were consistent. Findings were generally similar for all three disciplines. An email survey of academic psychologists confirmed that CIs elicit better interpretations if NHST is not invoked. Improved statistical inference can result from encouragement of meta-analytic thinking and use of CIs but, for full benefit, such highly desirable statistical reform requires also that researchers interpret CIs without recourse to NHST.},

abstract = {Abstract: Proteins diffuse to their sites of action within cells in a crowded, strongly interacting environment of nucleic acids and other macromolecules. To investigate the dynamics of a typical globular protein in such an environment, we used fluorescence photobleaching recovery to measure the probe diffusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in dilute to highly concentrated aqueous solutions of glycerol, Ficoll 70, and persistence-length calf thymus DNA. In glycerol, GFP accurately obeyed the Stokes-Einstein equation that relates diffusion coefficient to solution viscosity. In concentrated Ficoll 70, GFP diffused moderately faster than predicted from viscosity, demonstrating the phenomenon of microviscosity in a molecularly heterogeneous solution. In DNA, the diffusion coefficient of GFP was markedly greater than predicted from the Stokes-Einstein equation, with deviations increasing at lower ionic strength. This behavior reflects microviscosity, Coulombic interactions, and the dynamics of probe diffusion in DNA solutions that had undergone the ordinary-extraordinary transition, which we demonstrated by dynamic light scattering.},

abstract = {The inherently nonlinear interaction between light and motion in cavity optomechanical systems has experimentally been studied in a linearized description in all except highly driven cases. Here we demonstrate a nanoscale optomechanical system, in which the interaction between light and motion is so large (single-photon cooperativity {\$}C{\_}0 \backslashapprox 10{\^{}}3{\$}) that thermal motion induces optical frequency fluctuations larger than the intrinsic optical linewidth. The system thereby operates in a fully nonlinear regime, which pronouncedly impacts the optical response, displacement measurement, and radiation pressure backaction. Experiments show that the apparent optical linewidth is dominated by thermomechanically-induced frequency fluctuations over a wide temperature range. The nonlinearity induces breakdown of the traditional cavity optomechanical descriptions of thermal displacement measurements. Moreover, we explore how radiation pressure backaction in this regime affects the mechanical fluctuation spectra. The strong nonlinearity could serve as a resource to control the motional state of the resonator. We demonstrate the use of highly nonlinear transduction to perform a quadratic measurement of position while suppressing linear transduction.},

abstract = {The discipline of systems engineering, over the past five decades, has used a structured systematic approach to managing the “cradle to grave” development of products and processes. While elements of this approach are typically used to guide the development of information systems that instantiate a significant user interface, it appears to be rare for the entire process to be implemented. In fact, a number of authors have put forth development lifecycle models that are subsets of the classical systems engineering method, but fail to include steps such as incremental hazard analysis and post-deployment corrective and preventative actions. In that most health information systems have safety implications, we argue that the design and development of such systems would benefit by implementing this systems engineering approach in full. Particularly with regard to bringing a human-centered perspective to the formulation of system requirements and the configuration of effective user interfaces, this classical systems engineering method provides an excellent framework for incorporating human factors (ergonomics) knowledge and integrating ergonomists in the interdisciplinary development of health information systems.},

Some accomplishments of these initiatives are noted, but this article focuses on why they do not provide a general solution for what ails psychology. There are inherent limitations to mass replications ever being conducted in many areas of psychology, both in terms of their practicality and their prospects for improving the science. Unnecessary compromises were built into the ground rules for design and publication of the Open Science Collaboration: Psychology that undermine its effectiveness. Some ground rules could actually be flipped into guidance for how not to conduct replications. Greater adherence to best publication practices, transparency in the design and publishing of research, strengthening of independent post-publication peer review and firmer enforcement of rules about data sharing and declarations of conflict of interest would make many replications unnecessary. Yet, it has been difficult to move beyond simple endorsement of these measures to consistent implementation. Given the strong institutional support for questionable publication practices, progress will depend on effective individual and collective use of social media to expose lapses and demand reform. Some recent incidents highlight the necessity of this.},

abstract = {H ere's an example of inconsistent behavior. A statisti-cian challenges a speeding ticket in court by arguing that the radar evidence was inconclusive and questioning whether the instrument was properly calibrated. Later in the day, the statistician watches a baseball game and is impressed with pitches clocked at 99 or 100 miles per hour. On the one hand, the statistician believes the TV net-work's radar gun can accurately peg, to the nearest mile per hour (mph), the speed of a small ball that is only visible for about 1 second. On the other, the statistician claims a police officer can't prove an SUV was trav-eling 20 mph over the speed limit on an open stretch of road. We want to explore another example of inconsistent behavior that's far more consequential. As statisticians, we give firm guidance in our consulting and research on the virtues of random sampling, randomized treatment assignments, valid and reliable measurements, and clear specification of the statistical procedures that will be applied to data. With self-assured confidence that we occupy the moral high ground, we share horror stories about convenience samples, selection bias, multiple comparisons, and other problems that arise when those less enlightened about proper methodology don't follow the rules. But are we really consistent in all aspects of our professional lives? How do we approach teaching? The following generalizations apply to most of us: We assign grades based on exams that would almost surely be revealed to be low in both reliability and validity if we were to ever actually examine their psychometric properties. Despite teaching the same courses year after year, we rarely use standardized tests. We almost never use pre-tests at the beginning of the semester, either to adjust for differences between students in different sections of a course or even for the more direct goal of assessing what has actually been learned by students in our classes. We evaluate teachers based on student evaluations which, in addition to all their problems as measuring instruments, are presumably subject to huge nonresponse biases. Would we tolerate client satisfaction surveys as the only measure of hospital quality? We try out new ideas haphazardly. Not only do we not do randomized experiments, we generally do not perform any systematic comparisons of treatments at all. As one high-level administrator put it to us recently, "It would be good if we introduced our new teaching methods based on something more than a 'hunch'."},

@techreport{Gelman2012,
abstract = {1. The choice to not use all available information Debates about statistical foundations can be annoying to practitioners but are important in that foundational claims are used to make general recommendations for practice. All statistical methods allow prior information to be used in the design of a study, or in choosing what variables to include and how to transform them, or in the interpretation of results. What distinguishes Bayesian methods is the expression of prior information in the form of probability distributions on parameters in a model. But this is controversial. Most directly, technical arguments about the efficiency of different statistical procedures translate directly into ethical concerns. As quantitative researchers, we are supposed to use the most accurate estimates and the most honest statements of uncertainty, using statistically inferior methods only in response to other concerns such as simplicity, cost, or substantive theory. For example, in his "bread and peace" model, political scientist Douglas Hibbs forecasts presidential election outcomes given only two variables, one summarizing economic trends in the year or so leading up to the election and the other being a measure of military casualties during the president's term. The accuracy of the predictions is impressive given that the model is so simple-and that gives us insight into the politics of elections. Hibbs emphasizes that his model is not intended to produce the most accurate forecasts, which would require augmenting his predictors with other information such as recent polls. It would be unethical, or at best incompetent, to present Hibbs's model as a state-of-the-art forecast given that other useful information is available. But the fitted model stands on its own terms as a statement about elections. Hibbs's model is not Bayesian (at least, not explicitly so). It is relevant to our discussion here to illustrate that a model which is weak for one purpose can be strong for another. Similarly, as I have written elsewhere, "There is a class of problems where, for ethical or security reasons, it is illegal or inappropriate to use all available information. For example, the Census is not allowed to release fine-grained cross-tabulations that could be used to deduce information about individual people; racial profiling cannot be used in making mortgage decisions; and students' Calculus 1 grades and SAT scores would not be used in determining their grades in Calculus 2, even though these pieces of},

Unfortunately, statistics-and the scientific process more generally-often seems to be used more as a way of laundering uncertainty, processing data until researchers and consumers of research can feel safe acting as if various scientific hypotheses are unquestionably true. A recent article in the Economist asked whether science was self-correcting, focusing on failures to replicate and the widespread concern that many areas of the scientific literature are not as reliable as we want to believe. This wasn't the first time we've read in the financial press about an overheated domain, awash in liquidity and expanding quickly, driven by its own internal logic, where risk was understated and under-appreciated, but where professionals and consumers alike continued to buy in and operate with a faith that the good times would go on forever. We have in mind an analogy with the notorious AAA-class bonds created during the mid-2000s that led to the subprime mortgage crisis. Lower-quality mortgages-that is, mortgages with high probability of default and, thus, high uncertainty-were packaged and transformed into financial instruments that were (in retrospect, falsely) characterized as low risk. There was a tremendous interest in these securities, not just among the most unscrupulous market manipulators, but in a world where a lot of money was looking for safe investments and investors were willing to believe the ratings agencies and brokers.},

To that end, we investigated the prevalence of different statistical procedures and the nature of statistical reporting practices in recent articles from the four major Canadian psychology journals. The majority of authors evaluated their research hypotheses through the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-tests, and multiple regression. Multivariate approaches were less common. Null hypothesis significance testing remains a popular strategy, but the majority of authors reported a standardized or unstandardized effect size measure alongside their significance test results. Confidence intervals on effect sizes were infrequently employed. Many authors provided minimal details about their statistical analyses and less than a third of the articles presented on data complications such as missing data and violations of statistical assumptions. Strengths of and areas needing improvement for reporting quantitative results are highlighted.

abstract = {Over the past 75 years, a number of statisticians have advised that the data-analysis method known as null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) should be deprecated (Berkson, 1942; Halsey et al., 2015). The limitations of NHST have been extensively discussed, with an emerging consensus that current statistical practice in the biological sciences needs reform. However, there is less agreement on the specific nature of reform, with vigorous debate surrounding what would constitute a suitable alternative (Altman et al., 2000; Benjamin et al., 2017; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). An emerging view is that a more complete analytic technique would use statistical graphics to estimate effect sizes and their uncertainty (Cohen, 1994; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). As these estimation methods require only minimal statistical retraining, they have great potential to change the current data-analysis culture away from dichotomous thinking towards quantitative reasoning (Claridge-Chang and Assam, 2016). The evolution of statistics has been inextricably linked to the development of improved quantitative displays that support complex visual reasoning (Tufte, 2001). We consider that the graphic we describe here as an estimation plot is the most intuitive way to display the complete statistical information about experimental data sets. However, a major obstacle to adopting estimation is accessibility to suitable software. To overcome this hurdle, we have developed free software that makes high-quality estimation plotting available to all. Here, we explain the rationale for estimation plots by contrasting them with conventional charts used to display NHST data, and describe how the use of these graphs affords five major analytical advantages.},

The second objective was to determine how this problem and the misconceptions were treated in 12 recent textbooks used in education research methods and statistics classes. The third objective was to examine how the textbooks' presentations relate to current best practices and how much help they provide for students. The results show that almost all of the textbooks fail to acknowledge that there is controversy surrounding NHST. Most of the textbooks dealt, at least minimally, with the alleged misconceptions of interest, but they provided relatively little help for students.},

abstract = {Traditional Null Hypothesis Testing procedures are poorly adapted to theory testing. The methodology can mislead researchers in several ways, including: (a) a lack of power can result in an erroneous rejection of the theory; (b) the focus on directionality (ordinal tests) rather than more precise quantitative predictions limits the information gained; and (c) the misuse of probability values to indicate effect size. An alternative approach is proposed which involves employing the theory to generate explicit effect size predictions that are compared to the effect size estimates and related confidence intervals to test the theoretical predictions. This procedure is illustrated employing the Transtheoretical Model. Data from a sample (N = 3,967) of smokers from a large New England HMO system were used to test the model. There were a total of 15 predictions evaluated, each involving the relation between Stage of Change and one of the other 15 Transtheoretical Model variables. For each variable, omega-squared and the related confidence interval were calculated and compared to the predicted effect sizes. Eleven of the 15 predictions were confirmed, providing support for the theoretical model. Quantitative predictions represent a much more direct, informative, and strong test of a theory than the traditional test of significance.},

Extant methods of assessing such predictions, however, do not allow researchers to examine the outcome of the predictions in great detail. That is, it may be difficult to determine how estimates fail to match predicted values. As Meehl argued, one must examine how a theory fails to predict in order to refine and improve the theory. To promote better theory appraisal in FFM research, we present a powerful new tool, called a tableplot (Kwan, 2008a), that can summarize and clarify factor analytic results.

We described the results of two different experiments published in a major psychological journal to a sample of students of psychology, labeling the findings as ‘significant' versus ‘non-significant.' Participants were asked to estimate the effect sizes and sample sizes of the original studies. Labeling the results of a study as significant was associated with estimations of a big effect, but was largely unrelated to sample size. Similarly, non-significant results were estimated as near zero in effect size. After considerable training in statistics, students largely equate statistical significance with medium to large effect sizes, rather than with large sample sizes. The data show that students assume that statistical significance is due to real effects, rather than to ‘statistical tricks' (e.g., increasing sample size).},

In this paper, we review four statistical cognition studies that used mixed methods and explain the contributions of both the quantitative and qualitative components. The four studies investigated concern statistical reporting practices in medical journals, an intervention aimed at improving psychologists' interpretations of statistical tests, the extent to which interpretations improve when results are presented with confidence intervals (CIs) rather than p-values, and graduate students' misconceptions about CIs. Finally, we discuss the concept of scientific rigour and outline guidelines for maintaining rigour that should apply equally to qualitative and quantitative research.},

abstract = {Practitioners and teachers should be able to justify their chosen techniques by taking into account research results: This is evidence-based practice (EBP). We argue that, specifically, statistical practice and statistics education should be guided by evidence, and we propose statistical cognition (SC) as an integration of theory, research, and application to support EBP. SC is an interdisciplinary research field, and a way of thinking. We identify three facets of SC-normative, descriptive, and prescriptive-and discuss their mutual influences. Unfortunately, the three components are studied by somewhat separate groups of scholars, who publish in different journals. These separations impede the implementation of EBP. SC, however, integrates the facets and provides a basis for EBP in statistical practice and education.},

For frequentists, statistical developments such as structural equation modeling and multilevel modeling have facilitated this transition. For Bayesians, the Bayes factor has facilitated this transition. The Bayes factor is treated in articles within this issue of Multivariate Behavioral Research. The current presentation provides brief commentary on those articles and more extended discussion of the transition toward a modern modeling epistemology.

Correspondence between lab- and field-based effect sizes of conceptually similar independent and dependent variables was considerable. In brief, the psychological laboratory has generally produced psychological truths, rather than trivialities. These same data suggest that a companion truism about field studies in psychology—that they are generally low on internal validity—is also false.},

However, the pursuit of big data remains an uncertain and risky undertaking for the average psychological researcher. In this article, we address some of this uncertainty by discussing the potential impact of big data on the type of data available for psychological research, addressing the benefits and most significant challenges that emerge from these data, and organizing a variety of research opportunities for psychology. Our article yields two central insights. First, we highlight that big data research efforts are more readily accessible than many researchers realize, particularly with the emergence of open-source research tools, digital platforms, and instrumentation. Second, we argue that opportunities for big data research are diverse and differ both in their fit for varying research goals, as well as in the challenges they bring about. Ultimately, our outlook for researchers in psychology using and benefiting from big data is cautiously optimistic. Although not all big data efforts are suited for all researchers or all areas within psychology, big data research prospects are diverse, expanding, and promising for psychology and related disciplines.},

One type of bias, known as “p-hacking,” occurs when researchers collect or select data or statistical analyses until nonsignificant results become significant. Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes beingmeasured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values reported as significant than in p-values reported as nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called “co-pilot model,” and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in one's own manuscript or during the review process.},

abstract = {As the field of psychology struggles to trust published findings, replication research has begun to become more of a priority to both scientists and journals. With this increasing emphasis placed on reproducibility, it is essential that replication studies be capable of advancing the field. However, we argue that many researchers have been only narrowly interpreting the meaning of replication, with studies being designed with a simple statistically significant or nonsignificant results framework in mind. Although this interpretation may be desirable in some cases, we develop a variety of additional “replication goals” that researchers could consider when planning studies. Even if researchers are aware of these goals, we show that they are rarely used in practice—as results are typically analyzed in a manner only appropriate to a simple significance test. We discuss each goal conceptually, explain appropriate analysis procedures, and provide 1 or more examples to illustrate these analyses in practice. We hope that these various goals will allow researchers to develop a more nuanced understanding of replication that can be flexible enough to answer the various questions that researchers might seek to understand.

abstract = {We discuss problems the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm poses for replication and more broadly in the biomedical and social sciences as well as how these problems remain unresolved by proposals involving modified p-value thresholds, confidence intervals, and Bayes factors. We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm--and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it--as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to "ban" p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

abstract = {Many statistical methods yield the probability of the observed data – or data more extreme – under the assumption that a particular hypothesis is true. This probability is commonly known as ‘the' p value. (Null Hypothesis) Significance Testing ([NH]ST) is the most prominent of these methods. The p value has been subjected to much speculation, analysis, and criticism. We explore how well the p value predicts what researchers presumably seek: the probability of the hypothesis being true given the evidence, and the probability of reproducing significant results. We also explore the effect of sample size on inferential accuracy, bias, and error. In a series of simulation experiments, we find that the p value performs quite well as a heuristic cue in inductive inference, although there are identifiable limits to its usefulness. We conclude that despite its general usefulness, the p value cannot bear the full burden of inductive inference; it is but one of several heuristic cues available to the data analyst. Depending on the inferential challenge at hand, investigators may supplement their reports with effect size estimates, Bayes factors, or other suitable statistics, to communicate what they think the data say.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to investigate the decision qualities of the Bayes factor (BF) method compared with the p value-based null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The performance of the 2 methods is assessed in terms of the false- and true-positive rates, as well as the false-discovery rates and the posterior probabilities of the null hypothesis for 2 different models: an independent- samples t test and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with 2 random factors. Our simulation study results showed the following: (a) The common BF ? 3 criterion is more conservative than the NHST ?? .05 criterion, and it corresponds better with the ?? .01 criterion. (b) An increasing sample size has a different effect on the false-positive rate and the false-discovery rate, depending on whether the BF or NHST approach is used. (c) When effect sizes are randomly sampled from the prior, power curves tend to be flat compared with when effect sizes are prespecified. (d) The larger the scale factor (or the wider the prior), the more conservative the inferential decision is. (e) The false-positive and true-positive rates of the BF method are very sensitive to the scale factor when the effect size is small. (f) While the posterior probabilities of the null hypothesis ideally follow from the BF value, they can be surprisingly high using NHST. In general, these findings were consistent independent of which of the 2 different models was used.},

@article{Feldman2001,
abstract = {The process by which the human visual system parses an image into contours, surfaces, and objects--perceptual grouping--has proven difficult to capture in a rigorous and general theory. A natural candidate for such a theory is Bayesian probability theory, which provides optimal interpretations of data under conditions of uncertainty. But the fit of Bayesian theory to human grouping judgments has never been tested, in part because methods for expressing grouping hypotheses probabilistically have not been available. This paper presents such methods for the case of contour integration--that is, the aggregation of a sequence of visual items into a "virtual curve." Two experiments are reported in which human subjects were asked to group ambiguous configurations of dots (in Experiment 1, a sequence of five dots could be judged to contain a "corner" or not; in Experiment 2, an arrangement of six dots could be judged to fall into two disjoint contours or one smooth contour). The Bayesian theory accounts extremely well for subjects' judgments, explaining more than 75{\%} of the variance in both tasks. The theory thus provides a far more quantitatively precise account of human contour integration than has been previously possible, allowing a very precise calculation of the subjective goodness of a virtual chain of dots. Because Bayesian theory is inferentially optimal, this finding suggests a "rational justification," and hence possibly an evolutionary rationale, for some of the rules of perceptual grouping.},

abstract = {Sets of similar objects are common occurrences-a crowd of people, a bunch of bananas, a copse of trees, a shelf of books, a line of cars. Each item in the set may be distinct, highly visible, and dis-criminable. But when we look away from the set, what information do we have? The current article starts to address this question by introducing the idea of a set representation. This idea was tested using two new paradigms: mean discrimination and member identification. Three experiments using sets of different-sized spots showed that observers know a set's mean quite accurately but know little about the individual items, except their range. Taken together, these results suggest that the visual system represents the overall statistical, and not individual, properties of sets. Sets of similar objects are common occurrences-a crowd of people , a bunch of bananas, a copse of trees, a row of fence posts, a shelf of books, a line of cars. Each item in the set is distinct, highly visible, and discriminable. But when we look away from the set, what information do we have? If something in the set particularly catches our eye, we may retain quite a bit of information about it. A rich representation will also be formed if we had some appropriate categories available such as the names of several people in the crowd. However, when the stimuli do not fall into preformed categories, what information do we have about each of the individual items? What information do we have about the set of items as a whole? Our language supports the idea that a crowd, a bunch, a copse, or a set is somehow different from the sum of its parts. The work reported here examined whether the human visual system makes similar distinctions and represents properties of items in sets as individual items or as a whole. The experiments begin to address the question: Does the visual system create a specific representation for a set of similar objects that is not just the sum of the representations of the individual items? Two new paradigms were used to determine what observers know about the members of a set and what they know about the statistical properties of the set (mean and distribution). Comparing the accuracy with which observers represent information about parts and sets allows us not only to answer these general questions, but also to distinguish between two general approaches to understanding the perception and representation of multiple items. The first approach suggests that when many items are presented, the visual system encodes only low-resolution information about each of them (Neisser, 1967). Such an approach is consistent with limited-capacity models of visual processing: If the visual system has a bottleneck at some point, then the more items there are to process at one time, the fewer bits there are available to represent each one (Nakayama, 1990). The second approach suggests that there may be more efficient ways of dealing with limited capacity than simply reducing the resolution of the local representation. The idea here is that sets of objects could be represented in a qualitatively different way than single items. Therefore , when presented with a set of objects, the visual system does not face trade-offs involving the resolution for encoding local information , but rather decides how to divide resources between the two types of representations (individual and set). GENERAL METHOD This article reports the results of three experiments that were identical in many regards. In particular, the sets and test stimuli in all the experiments consisted of circular spots of various sizes. Such sets have the advantage that the members do not fall into distinct categories , as they could if they varied in color, shape, or orientation. Two of the experiments measured knowledge about the sizes of the individual spots in a set (member-identification experiments), and one measured sensitivity to the mean size of a set (mean-discrimination experiment). In all the experiments, a set of spots was presented in the first temporal interval of a two-interval trial, and a test stimulus, consisting of one or two test spots, was presented in the second interval. An example of a stimulus pair is shown in Figure 1. Both temporal intervals in a trial were 500 ms in duration. There was no blank time between intervals. The 2 observers were male undergraduate students who had normal vision and were naive as to the purpose of the experiment. The same 2 observers participated in all three experiments. No feedback about the correctness of responses was given in any experiment. Each set consisted of spots of four sizes that were equally spaced on a log scale. Each size was separated from the next size by a factor of either 1.05 or 1.4 (n). The mean spot diameter was 0.25. The 1.05 sets included spots of similar sizes-diameters ranged from 0.23 to 0.27 ; the 1.4 sets included spots with dissimilar sizes-diameters ranged from 0.15 to 0.42. These two sets are referred to as sets of similar and dissimilar spots, respectively. Sets with 4, 8, 12, and 16 spots were used, with 1, 2, 3, or 4 spots of each of the four sizes, respectively. The spatial arrangements of the sets were random, with constraints on overall area and minimum proximity between spots to make the average density roughly constant. An example of a set of dissimilar spots (factor of 1.4) is shown in Figure 1 together with a sample test spot. The range of sizes of the test spots exceeded the range of the spots in the sets by the difference between the spot sizes themselves (the factor size). Each set of spots (and its corresponding test spots) was presented in 15 versions: five differently randomly scaled versions, each presented in three different spatial arrangements. The different versions were used to discourage the observers from basing their judgments on previously seen stimuli. In the data analysis and presentation of results , size of the test spot is represented relative to the mean of the set with which it was presented, averaged over the 15 versions.},

In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychology's academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result—a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label “confirmatory,” and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled “exploratory.” We illustrate...},

Typical first-year courses serve well only those students who undertake traditional laboratory research. Training in top-ranked schools differs little from that in other schools. New PhDs are judged to be competent to handle traditional techniques, but not newer and often more useful procedures, in their own research.

abstract = {Finkel, Eastwick, and Reis (2015; “FER2015”) argued that psychological science is better served by responding to apprehensions about replicability rates with contextualized solutions than with one-size-fits-all solutions. Here, we extend FER2015's analysis to suggest that much of the discussion of best research practices since 2011 has focused on a single feature of high-quality science—replicability—with insufficient sensitivity to the implications of recommended practices for other features, like discovery, internal validity, external validity, construct validity, consequentiality, and cumulativeness. Thus, although recommendations for bolstering replicability have been innovative, compelling, and abundant, it is difficult to evaluate their impact on our science as a whole, especially because many research practices that are beneficial for some features of scientific quality are harmful for others. For example, FER2015 argued that bigger samples are generally better, but also noted that very large samples (“those larger than required for effect sizes to stabilize”; p. 291) could have the downside of commandeering resources that would have been better invested in other studies. In their critique of FER2015, LeBel, Campbell, and Loving (2016; “LCL2016”) concluded, based on simulated data, that ever-larger samples are better for the efficiency of scientific discovery (i.e., that there are no tradeoffs). As demonstrated here, however, this conclusion holds only when the replicator's resources are considered in isolation. If we widen the assumptions to include the original researcher's resources as well, which is necessary if the goal is to consider resource investment for the field as a whole, the conclusion changes radically—and strongly supports a tradeoff-based analysis. In general, as psychologists seek to strengthen our science, we must complement our much-needed work on increasing replicability with careful attention to the other features of a high-quality science.},

Building on Sakaluk's (in this issue) distinction between exploration and confirmation, I argue that this shift will increase correctness of findings, but at the expense of exploration and discovery. The likely effects on the field include aversion to risk, increased difficulty in building careers and hence more capricious hiring and promotion policies, loss of interdisciplinary influence, and rising interest in small, weak findings. Winners (who stand to gain from the mooted changes) include researchers with the patience and requisite resources to assemble large samples; incompetent experimenters; destructive iconoclasts; competing subfields of psychology; and lower-ranked journals, insofar as they publish creative work with small samples. The losers are young researchers; writers of literature reviews and textbooks; flamboyant, creative researchers with lesser levels of patience; and researchers at small colleges. My position is that the field has actually done quite well in recent decades, and improvement should be undertaken as further refinement of a successful approach, in contrast to the Cassandrian view that the field's body of knowledge is hopelessly flawed and radical, revolutionary change is needed. I recommend we retain the exploratory research approach alongside the new, large-sample confirmatory work.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Policy Points: r Currently, there is massive production of unnecessary, misleading, and conflicted systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Instead of promoting evidence-based medicine and health care, these instruments often serve mostly as easily produced publishable units or marketing tools. r Suboptimal systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be harmful given the major prestige and influence these types of studies have acquired. r The publication of systematic reviews and meta-analyses should be realigned to remove biases and vested interests and to integrate them better with the primary production of evidence. Context: Currently, most systematic reviews and meta-analyses are done retro-spectively with fragmented published information. This article aims to explore the growth of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses and to estimate how often they are redundant, misleading, or serving conflicted interests. Methods: Data included information from PubMed surveys and from empirical evaluations of meta-analyses. Findings: Publication of systematic reviews and meta-analyses has increased rapidly. In the period January 1, 1986, to December 4, 2015, PubMed tags 266,782 items as " systematic reviews " and 58,611 as " meta-analyses. " An-nual publications between 1991 and 2014 increased 2,728{\%} for systematic reviews and 2,635{\%} for meta-analyses versus only 153{\%} for all PubMed-indexed items. Currently, probably more systematic reviews of trials than new randomized trials are published annually. Most topics addressed by meta-analyses of randomized trials have overlapping, redundant meta-analyses; same-topic meta-analyses may exceed 20 sometimes. Some fields produce massive numbers of meta-analyses; for example, 185 meta-analyses of antidepressants for depression were published between 2007 and 2014. These meta-analyses are often produced either by industry employees or by authors with industry ties and results are aligned with sponsor interests. China has rapidly become the most prolific producer of English-language, PubMed-indexed meta-analyses. The most massive presence of Chinese meta-analyses is on genetic associations (63{\%} of global production in 2014), where almost all results are misleading since they combine fragmented information from mostly abandoned era of can-didate genes. Furthermore, many contracting companies working on evidence synthesis receive industry contracts to produce meta-analyses, many of which probably remain unpublished. Many other meta-analyses have serious flaws. Of the remaining, most have weak or insufficient evidence to inform decision making. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses are both non-misleading and useful. Conclusions: The production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses has reached epidemic proportions. Possibly, the large majority of produced system-atic reviews and meta-analyses are unnecessary, misleading, and/or conflicted.},

In the first set of simulations, study results differed substantially across replications as a result of measurement error alone.

The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial.

abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

In this article, we review research on how applied researchers who are not primarily statisticians misuse and misin-terpret p-values in practice and how this can lead to errors in the interpretation of evidence. We also present new data showing, perhaps surprisingly, that researchers who are primarily statisticians are also prone to misuse and misinterpret p-values thus resulting in similar errors. In particular, we show that statisticians tend to interpret evidence dichotomously based on whether or not a p-value crosses the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance.

@article{Francis2012,
abstract = {Like other scientists, psychologists believe experimental replication to be the final arbiter for determining the validity of an empirical finding. Reports in psychology journals often attempt to prove the validity of a hypothesis or theory with multiple experiments that replicate a finding. Unfortunately, these efforts are sometimes misguided because in a field like experimental psychology, ever more successful replication does not necessarily ensure the validity of an empirical finding. When psychological experiments are analyzed with statistics, the rules of probability dictate that random samples should sometimes be selected that do not reject the null hypothesis, even if an effect is real. As a result, it is possible for a set of experiments to have too many successful replications. When there are too many successful replications for a given set of experiments, a skeptical scientist should be suspicious that null or negative findings have been suppressed, the experiments were run improperly, or the experiments were analyzed improperly. This article describes the implications of this observation and demonstrates how to test for too much successful replication by using a set of experiments from a recent research paper.},

abstract = {The ability to self-correct is considered a hallmark of science. However, self-correction does not always happen to scientific evidence by default. The trajectory of scientific credibility can fluctuate over time, both for defined scientific fields and for science at-large. History suggests that major catastrophes in scientific credibility are unfortunately possible and the argument that “it is obvious that progress is made” is weak. Careful evaluation of the current status of credibility of various scientific fields is important in order to understand any credibility deficits and how one could obtain and establish more trustworthy results. Efficient and unbiased replication mechanisms are essential for maintaining high levels of scientific credibility. Depending on the types of results obtained in the discovery and replication phases, there are different paradigms of research: optimal, self-correcting, false nonreplication, and perpetuated fallacy. In the absence of replication efforts, one is left with unconfirmed (genuine) discoveries and unchallenged fallacies. In several fields of investigation, including many areas of psychological science, perpetuated and unchallenged fallacies may comprise the majority of the circulating evidence. I catalogue a number of impediments to self-correction that have been empirically studied in psychological science. Finally, I discuss some proposed solutions to promote sound replication practices enhancing the credibility of scientific results as well as some potential disadvantages of each of them. Any deviation from the principle that seeking the truth has priority over any other goals may be seriously damaging to the self-correcting functions of science.},

Here I hypothesize why similar attempts to clarify matters have also failed; namely because both procedures are designed to be confused: their names may not match purpose, both use null hypotheses and levels of significance yet for different goals, and p-values, errors, alternative hypotheses, and significance only apply to one procedure yet are commonly used with both. I also propose a reconceptualization of the procedures to prevent further confusion.},

abstract = {This article considers the nature and place of tests of statistical significance (ToSS) in science, with particular reference to psychology. Despite the enormous amount of attention given to this topic, psychology's understanding of ToSS remains deficient. The major problem stems from a widespread and uncritical acceptance of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), which is an indefensible amalgam of ideas adapted from Fisher's thinking on the subject and from Neyman and Pearson's alternative account. To correct for the deficiencies of the hybrid, it is suggested that psychology avail itself of two important and more recent viewpoints on ToSS, namely the neo-Fisherian and the error-statistical perspectives. The neo-Fisherian perspective endeavors to improve on Fisher's original account and rejects key elements of Neyman and Pearson's alternative. In contrast, the error-statistical perspective builds on the strengths of both statistical traditions. It is suggested that these more recent outlooks on ToSS are a definite improvement on NHST, especially the error-statistical position. It is suggested that ToSS can play a useful, if limited, role in psychological research. At the end, some lessons learnt from the extensive debates about ToSS are presented.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

Nonetheless, surprisingly few graphs communicate effectively, and most graphs fail because they do not take into account the goals, needs, and abilities of the viewers. In Graph Design for Eye and Mind, Stephen Kosslyn addresses these problems by presenting eight psychological principles for constructing effective graphs. Each principle is solidly rooted both in the scientific literature on how we perceive and comprehend graphs and in general facts about how our eyes and brains process visual information. Kosslyn then uses these eight psychological principles as the basis for hundreds of specific recommendations that serve as a concrete, step-by-step guide to deciding whether a graph is an appropriate display to use, choosing the correct type of graph for a specific type of data and message, and then constructing graphs that will be understood at a glance. Kosslyn also includes a complete review of the scientific literature on graph perception and comprehension, and appendices that provide a quick tutorial on basic statistics and a checklist for evaluating computer-graphics programs. Graph Design for Eye and Mind is an invaluable reference for anyone who uses visual displays to convey information in the sciences, humanities, and businesses such as finance, marketing, and advertising.},

abstract = {Inference using significance testing and Bayes fac-tors is compared and contrasted in five case studies based on real research. The first study illustrates that the methods will often agree, both in motivating researchers to conclude that H1 is supported better than H0, and the other way round, that H0 is better supported than H1. The next four, however, show that the methods will also often disagree. In these cases, the aim of the paper will be to motivate the sensible evidential conclusion, and then see which approach matches those intu-itions. Specifically, it is shown that a high-powered non-sig-nificant result is consistent with no evidence for H0 over H1 worth mentioning, which a Bayes factor can show, and, con-versely, that a low-powered non-significant result is consistent with substantial evidence for H0 over H1, again indicated by Bayesian analyses. The fourth study illustrates that a high-powered significant result may not amount to any evidence for H1 over H0, matching the Bayesian conclusion. Finally, the fifth study illustrates that different theories can be eviden-tially supported to different degrees by the same data; a fact that P-values cannot reflect but Bayes factors can. It is argued that appropriate conclusions match the Bayesian inferences, but not those based on significance testing, where they disagree.},

abstract = {Presents a new method for using texture to visualize multi-dimensional data elements arranged on an underlying 3D height field. We hope to use simple texture patterns in combination with other visual features like hue and intensity to increase the number of attribute values we can display simultaneously. Our technique builds perceptual texture elements (or pexels) to represent each data element. Attribute values encoded in the data element are used to vary the appearance of a corresponding pexel. Texture patterns that form when the pexels are displayed can be used to rapidly and accurately explore the dataset. Our pexels are built by controlling three separate texture dimensions: height, density and regularity. Results from computer graphics, computer vision and cognitive psychology have identified these dimensions as important for the formation of perceptual texture patterns. We conducted a set of controlled experiments to measure the effectiveness of these dimensions, and to identify any visual interference that may occur when all three are displayed simultaneously at the same spatial location. Results from our experiments show that these dimensions can be used in specific combinations to form perceptual textures for visualizing multidimensional datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by applying it to two real-world visualization environments: tracking typhoon activity in southeast Asia, and analyzing ocean conditions in the northern Pacific.},

Current approaches in visualization often display uncertainty as an additional data attribute without a well-defined context. Our goal was to test whether different graphical displays (glyphs) would influence a decision about which of 2 weather forecasts was a more accurate predictor of an uncertain temperature forecast value. We used a statistical inference task based on fictional univariate normal distributions, each characterized by a mean and standard deviation. Participants viewed 1 of 5 different glyph types representing 2 weather forecast distributions. Three of these used variations in spatial encoding to communicate the distributions and the other 2 used nonspatial encoding (brightness or color). Four distribution pairs were created with different relative standard deviations (uncertainty of the forecasts). We found that there was a difference in how decisions were made with spatial versus nonspatial glyphs, but no difference among the spatial glyphs themselves. Furthermore, the effect of different glyph types changed as a function of the variability of the distributions. The results are discussed in the context of how visualizations might improve decision making under uncertainty.},

abstract = {Previous research has shown that people exhibit a sample size bias when judging the average of a set of stimuli on a single dimension. The more stimuli there are in the set, the greater people judge the average to be. This effect has been demonstrated reliably for judgments of the average likelihood that groups of people will experience negative, positive, and neutral events (Price, 2001; Price, Smith, {\&} Lench, 2006) and also for estimates of the mean of sets of numbers (Smith {\&} Price, 2010). The present research focuses on whether this effect is observed for judgments of average on a perceptual dimension. In 5 experiments we show that people's judgments of the average size of the squares in a set increase as the number of squares in the set increases. This effect occurs regardless of whether the squares in each set are presented simultaneously or sequentially; whether the squares in each set are different sizes or all the same size; and whether the response is a rating of size, an estimate of area, or a comparative judgment. These results are consistent with a priming account of the sample size bias, in which the sample size activates a representation of magnitude that directly biases the judgment of average.

abstract = {Background. People's treatment decisions are often influenced by anecdotal rather than statistical information. This can lead to patients making decisions based on others' experiences rather than on evidence-based medicine. Objective. To test whether the use of a quiz or pictograph decreases peo- ple's reliance on anecdotal information. Design. Two cross- sectional survey studies using hypothetical scenarios. Partic- ipants read a scenario describing angina and indicated a preference for either bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty. The cure rate of both treatmentswas presented usingprose, a pictograph, a quiz, or a pictograph and quiz combination. Participants read anecdotes from hypothetical patients who described the outcome of their treatment; the number of suc- cessful anecdotes was either representative or unrepresenta- tive of the cure rates. Setting and Participants. Prospective jurorsat the PhiladelphiaCountyCourthouseandtravelersat the Detroit-Wayne County Metropolitan Airport. Measure- ments. Proportion of respondents preferring bypass over bal- loon angioplasty. Results. In study 1, when statistical infor- mation was presented in prose, treatment choices were influenced by anecdotes, with 41{\%} of participants choosing bypass when the anecdotes were representative and only 20{\%} choosing it when the anecdotes were unrepresentative ( 2 = 14.40, P {\textless} 0.001).When statistics were reinforced with the pictograph and quiz, anecdotes had no significant influ- ence on treatment decisions (38{\%}choosing bypasswhen an- ecdotes were representative v. 44{\%} when unrepresentative, 2=1.08,P{\textgreater}0.20).

abstract = {Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Bayesian inference (or, more generally, complex statistical modeling) --which are generally considered as unrelated statistical paradigms--can be particularly ef- fective in combination. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for EDA based on posterior predictive checks. We explain how posterior predictive simulations can be used to create reference dis- tributions for EDA graphs, and how this approach resolves some theoretical problems in Bayesian data analysis. We show how the generalization of Bayesian inference to include replicated data yr'e and repli- cated parameters Hrep follows a long tradition of generalizations in Bayesian theory. On the theoretical level, we present a predictive Bayesian formulation of goodness-of-fit testing, dis- tinguishing between p-values (posterior probabilities that specified antisymmetric discrepancy measures will exceed 0) and u-values (data summaries with uniform sampling distributions). We explain that p- values, unlike u-values, are Bayesian probability statements in that they condition on observed data. Having reviewed the general theoretical framework, we discuss the implications for statistical graphics and exploratory data analysis, with the goal being to unify exploratory data analysis with more formal statistical methods based on probability models. We interpret various graphical displays as posterior predictive checks and discuss how Bayesian inference can be used to determine reference distributions. The goal of this work is not to downgrade descriptive statistics, or to suggest they be replaced by Bayesian modeling, but rather to suggest how exploratory data analysis fits into the probability-modeling paradigm. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for practical Bayesian inference. In particular, we an- ticipate that Bayesian software can be generalized to draw simulations of replicated data and parameters from their posterior predictive distribution, and these can in turn be used to calibrate EDA graphs.},

Each item in the set may be distinct, highly visible, and discriminable. But when we look away from the set, what information do we have? The current article starts to address this question by introducing the idea of a set representation. This idea was tested using two new paradigms: mean discrimination and member identification. Three experiments using sets of different-sized spots showed that observers know a set's mean quite accurately but know little about the individual items, except their range. Taken together, these results suggest that the visual system represents the overall statistical, and not individual, properties of sets.},

@incollection{Behrens2012,
abstract = {Exploratory data analysis (EDA), pioneered by John W. Tukey (1915–2000), introduces a variety of innovative techniques and combines them with five important principles of data analysis: display, re-expression, residuals, resistance, and iteration. Many of the techniques that Tukey pioneered have become familiar: stem-and-leaf display, five-number summary, boxplot, and a rule for flagging potential outliers in batches of data. Computing methods have extended EDA to larger data sets and higher dimensions, and diagnostic statistics have extended the EDA approach to include more traditional statistical methods. Although its innovative methods have received much attention, the principal contribution of EDA is philosophical. EDA advocates exploring data for patterns and relationships without requiring prior hypotheses. The principle of resistance calls for identifying extraordinary cases and then setting them aside or downweighting them. Re-expression uses mathematical transformations to simplify patterns in data. EDA suggests that analyses are more scientifically useful and productive when data have been transformed to agree better with basic assumptions. Residuals come from summarizing the patterns found so far and subtracting that summary from the data, to reveal departures and additional patterns. EDA often works with residuals to refine or extend models fitted to data. Frequent use of graphical displays maintains contact with data, residuals, and summaries, and it often reveals unexpected behavior. EDA approaches do not terminate with a hypothesis test. Effective data analysis is iterative, finding and summarizing patterns and then probing more deeply. These approaches stand in contrast to the formalistic scientific method paradigm of first stating a hypothesis based on prior theory, then collecting data, and finally applying a statistical test of the hypothesis. Proponents of the EDA philosophy maintain that the EDA approach is more likely to discover new and interesting patterns and relationships, in much the same way that science has traditionally made progress. Exploratory analyses can incorporate methods of statistical inference, but use them more as indicators of the strength of a relationship or the fit of a model than as confirmation of a hypothesis. In this chapter, we elucidate the EDA approach, illustrating it with examples. We hope to convince the reader that this approach should be a standard part of anyone's analysis of data. For many experienced data analysts, an EDA approach forms the main ingredient of their analyses, with only the occasional “seasoning” of formal hypothesis testing.},

Belief in science moderates the persuasive effect of graphs, such that people who have a greater belief in science are more affected by the presence of graphs (Study 2). Overall, the studies contribute to past research by demonstrating that even trivial elements can increase public persuasion despite their not truly indicating scientific expertise or objective support.

@article{Amrhein2017,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The widespread use of ‘statistical significance' as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process (according to the American Statistical Association). We review why degrading {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -values into ‘significant' and ‘nonsignificant' contributes to making studies irreproducible, or to making them seem irreproducible. A major problem is that we tend to take small {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -values at face value, but mistrust results with larger {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -values. In either case, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -values tell little about reliability of research, because they are hardly replicable even if an alternative hypothesis is true. Also significance ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}  ≤ 0.05) is hardly replicable: at a good statistical power of 80{\%}, two studies will be ‘conflicting', meaning that one is significant and the other is not, in one third of the cases if there is a true effect. A replication can therefore not be interpreted as having failed only because it is nonsignificant. Many apparent replication failures may thus reflect faulty judgment based on significance thresholds rather than a crisis of unreplicable research. Reliable conclusions on replicability and practical importance of a finding can only be drawn using cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. However, applying significance thresholds makes cumulative knowledge unreliable. One reason is that with anything but ideal statistical power, significant effect sizes will be biased upwards. Interpreting inflated significant results while ignoring nonsignificant results will thus lead to wrong conclusions. But current incentives to hunt for significance lead to selective reporting and to publication bias against nonsignificant findings. Data dredging, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -hacking, and publication bias should be addressed by removing fixed significance thresholds. Consistent with the recommendations of the late Ronald Fisher, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -values should be interpreted as graded measures of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also larger {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -values offer some evidence against the null hypothesis, and they cannot be interpreted as supporting the null hypothesis, falsely concluding that ‘there is no effect'. Information on possible true effect sizes that are compatible with the data must be obtained from the point estimate, e.g., from a sample average, and from the interval estimate, such as a confidence interval. We review how confusion about interpretation of larger {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -values can be traced back to historical disputes among the founders of modern statistics. We further discuss potential arguments against removing significance thresholds, for example that decision rules should rather be more stringent, that sample sizes could decrease, or that {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -values should better be completely abandoned. We conclude that whatever method of statistical inference we use, dichotomous threshold thinking must give way to non-automated informed judgment. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The “replication crisis” has been attributed to misguided external incentives gamed by researchers (the strategic-game hypothesis). Here, I want to draw attention to a complementary internal factor, namely, researchers' widespread faith in a statistical ritual and associated delusions (the statistical-ritual hypothesis). The “null ritual,” unknown in statistics proper, eliminates judgment precisely at points where statistical theories demand it. The crucial delusion is that the p value specifies the probability of a successful replication (i.e., 1 – p), which makes replication studies appear to be superfluous. A review of studies with 839 academic psychologists and 991 students shows that the replication delusion existed among 20{\%} of the faculty teaching statistics in psychology, 39{\%} of the professors and lecturers, and 66{\%} of the students. Two further beliefs, the illusion of certainty (e.g., that statistical significance proves that an effect exists) and Bayesian wishful thinking (e.g., that the probabi...},

abstract = {Although the past few decades have seen much work in psychopathology research that has yielded provocative insights, relatively little progress has been made in understanding the etiology of mental disorders. We contend that this is due to an overreliance on statistics and technology with insufficient attention to adequacy of experimental design, a lack of integration of data across various domains of research, and testing of theoretical models using relatively weak study designs. We provide a conceptual discussion of these issues and follow with a concrete demonstration of our proposed solution. Using two different disorders—depression and substance use—as examples, we illustrate how we can evaluate competing theories regarding their etiology by integrating information from various domains including latent variable models, neurobiology, and quasi-experimental data such as twin and adoption studies, rather than relying on any single methodology alone. More broadly, we discuss the extent to which such inte...},

abstract = {Across academic disciplines, scientific progress is maximized when there is a balance between deductive and inductive approaches. To promote this balance in organizational science, rigorous inductive research aimed at phenomenon detection must be further encouraged. To this end, the present article discusses the logic and methods of exploratory data analysis (EDA), the mode of analysis concerned with discovery, exploration, and empirically detecting phenomena in data. We begin by first describing the historical and conceptual background of EDA. We then discuss two issues related to EDA and its relationship to scientific credibility. First, we argue that EDA fosters a replication-based science by requiring cross-validation and by emphasizing the natural uncertainty of data patterns. Second, we clarify that EDA is distinguishable from other exploratory practices that are considered scientifically questionable (e.g., “p-hacking”, “data fishing” and “data-dredging”). In the following section of the paper, we present a final argument for EDA: that it helps maximize the value of data. To illustrate this point, we present several graphical methods for detecting data patterns and provide references to further techniques for the interested reader.},

abstract = {A recent study of the replicability of key psychological findings is a major contribution toward understanding the human side of the scientific process. Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36{\%} of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77{\%} of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95{\%} prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers' intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals—and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.},

A good fit reveals nothing about the flexibility of the theory (how much it cannot fit), the variability of the data (how firmly the data rule out what the theory cannot fit), or the likelihood of other outcomes (perhaps the theory could have fit any plausible result), and a reader needs all 3 pieces of information to decide how much the fit should increase belief in the theory. The use of good fits as evidence is not supported by philosophers of science nor by the history of psychology; there seem to be no examples of a theory supported mainly by good fits that has led to demonstrable progress. A better way to test a theory with free parameters is to determine how the theory constrains possible outcomes (i.e., what it predicts), assess how firmly actual outcomes agree with those constraints, and determine if plausible alternative outcomes would have been inconsistent with the theory, allowing for the variability of the data.},

We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis.

This paper presents a tutorial for the teaching of data testing procedures, often referred to as hypothesis testing theories. The first procedure introduced is Fisher's approach to data testing—tests of significance; the second is Neyman-Pearson's approach—tests of acceptance; the final procedure is the incongruent combination of the previous two theories into the current approach—NSHT. For those researchers sticking with the latter, two compromise solutions on how to improve NHST conclude the tutorial.},

There are alternatives that address study design and sample size much more directly than significance testing does; but none of the statistical tools should be taken as the new magic method giving clear-cut mechanical answers. Inference should not be based on single studies at all, but on cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. When evaluating the strength of the evidence, we should consider, for example, auxiliary assumptions, the strength of the experimental design, and implications for applications.
